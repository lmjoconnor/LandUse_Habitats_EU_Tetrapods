A1;Alytes_cisternasii;"This species is closely associated with meadows and open oak ( Quercus ) forests, most often in sandy areas. Reproduction and larval development generally takes place in temporary waterbodies (most often stream habitats), occasionally in permanent waterbodies; larval development is relatively long in this species and may last more than one season. The species is not very adaptable.";;The main threats are the loss of suitable Mediterranean forest habitat, the introduction of predatory fishes and Louisiana Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ), and the loss of suitable aquatic habitats through pollution, canal construction, dams, and urbanization. A potential future threat is chytridiomycosis, which has already affected the related Alytes obstetricans in Spain.
A2;Alytes_dickhilleni;The species is present in pine and oak forests, most often on calciferous substrate, in open, very rocky landscapes. Adults occur in rock fissures and on stones next to water sources. Reproduction and larval development takes place in permanent mountain streams, man-made reservoirs and cattle troughs, and the larvae may take a long time to mature. Almost all known breeding habitats are human-modified water bodies.;;The species is threatened by loss of suitable breeding habitat as a result of excessive water withdrawal, droughts, and modernization of agricultural practices leading to the abandonment of cattle troughs and other man-made water sources. A potential future threat is the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, which has already impacted the related Alytes obstetricans in Spain.
A3;Alytes_muletensis;"It is currently found only in small streams deeply carved into limestone mountains. The presence of the species is positively associated with steep slopes. Breeding takes place in the small streams that persist as pools in summer. A few populations occur by man-made water sources (cattle troughs, containers, rain tanks etc.) in open mountainous country; these are within the river basins of nearby canyon-living populations. Animals are generally found in rock crevices and under stones. This species does not tolerate serious habitat degradation. The distribution of predators on the species is negatively associated with elevation, and reproductive success is positively associated with elevation.";;The major threats are predation by the introduced Viperine Snake ( Natrix maura ), and competition for space with Perez's Frog ( Rana perezi ). Development of tourism and human settlements, specifically the increased need for water resources (including damming and canalization of streams), is an additional threat. The threats are not likely to decrease, and so the current recovery programme needs to be continued more or less indefinitely. One isolated re-introduced population was impacted by an unidentified non-fungal disease in 2002 which killed some tadpoles. This disease did not recur in 2003 and 2004. Chytridiomycosis has been identified in the wild population, with the source of this chytrid infection traced to reintroduced captive-bred animals from Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, UK (Walker et al . 2008).
A4;Alytes_obstetricans;"It lives in terrestrial habitats, including temperate forests, semi-arid areas, walls, embankments, and slopes with small stones and sparse vegetation. Aquatic habitats in which the species breeds range from slow moving rivers to stagnant permanent ponds and pools; gravel and clay pits are also used. The larvae of this species frequently hibernate. The species can occur in suitable modified habitat such as traditional agricultural land, and even urban areas (e.g., in Barcelona).";;"General habitat loss, largely to agricultural development (including loss of breeding sites), has contributed to the decline of the species in some areas. Fragmentation of populations might be a problem for the species, e.g. in Spain, Portugal and Germany. Certain populations of the subspecies Alytes obstetricans pertinax in protected areas of central Spain have severely declined and disappeared as a result of chytridiomycosis (Bosch et al. , 2001; Bosch et al. , 2000); a few specimens have recently been found again in this area (M. García-París and J.W. Arntzen pers. comm.). Additional mortality of the species through disease (iridovirus) has been recorded in Carris Lake, Peneda-Gerês National Park, Portugal (Soares et al. , 2003); the disease might be non-native and have been transferred to the lake by an introduced North American predatory fish ( Lepomis gibbosus ). Mortality initially attributed to the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila ""red-leg disease"" has also been reported (Márquez et al. 1995). Predation by L. gibbosus and other introduced predatory fish species, such as salmonids, is also a considerable threat to this species."
A13;Discoglossus_galganoi;It is generally found within or in the direct vicinity of water (with surrounding dense vegetation), including still waters, swamps, mountain streams, drinking troughs and sometimes-brackish waters. The terrestrial habitats of the species occur on granite and other metamorphic rocks, and include sandy areas close to the sea, open areas, meadows, thickets, gulley's and woodland edges. The species breeds, and larval development takes place, within shallow permanent or temporary waterbodies. It is often present in slightly modified areas, such as traditional farmland.;;The main threats to this species are both a general intensification of agriculture and the introduction of predatory fishes and crustaceans (especially the Louisiana Crayfish- Procambarus clarkii ) through much of the species range. Desertification is a threat to the species in the more arid parts of its range such as southern Portugal. Additionally, hydroelectric projects are leading to habitat loss in parts of Portugal. However, overall this species is probably not seriously threatened at present.
A14;Discoglossus_jeanneae;An inhabitant of open areas, pine groves and shrubland associated with limestone or gypsum soils. This is a very aquatic species found in shallow pools, streams, springs, ponds and artificial water sources, such as drinking troughs and drainage channels. Breeding and larval development takes place within the aquatic habitats. It can be present in traditionally farmed areas.;;The major threat to this species is continued loss of habitat as a result of increased aridity throughout its range. It is also threatened by loss of suitable habitat (including fragmentation) to agricultural and infrastructure development. The species is particularly impacted by the loss, or contamination, of aquatic habitats (such as drinking troughs), and introductions of predatory fish and crustaceans, in particular the Louisiana Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ). Its populations are now fragmented in many parts of its range.
A15;Discoglossus_montalentii;This frog is strongly associated with running waters in high-altitude pristine woods and forests, and is especially found in areas with precipitous streams. The eggs are deposited under rocks and stones in mountain streams, with larvae developing in these streams.;;This species is threatened by introduced predatory salmonid fishes.
A16;Discoglossus_pictus;It is present in a wide variety of Mediterranean habitats including open, sandy coastal areas, pastures, vineyards, woods and forests, often in dense vegetation close to waterbodies. It breeds in most types of still water habitats, and is sometimes present in marshes and brackish water. In Sicily, populations have been associated with irrigation channels, water cisterns, pipes and canals in cultivated areas.;;Sicilian populations appear to be locally threatened (but not especially endangered) by a decline of traditional land-use, including urbanization. Maltese populations are reported to be threatened by groundwater extraction.
A17;Discoglossus_sardus;"The species inhabits a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial habitats including still and slow-running waters in open or wooded (coniferous and broadleaf) areas and maccia; it may even occur in slightly brackish pools. The eggs are deposited between aquatic vegetation in streams, and the larvae develop in these streams. The species can tolerate some habitat disturbance.";;It is threatened by general loss of suitable woodland and aquatic habitats. Aquatic habitats used by this species on Corsica (and presumably on Sardinia) are being lost through damming of streams and increased water abstraction for tourism. However, overall this species does not appear to be significantly threatened. There were some die-offs of this species in Sardinia in 2004 and 2006, but the cause is unknown (Bovero et a l. 2008).
A5;Bombina_bombina;"Within Europe this species is associated with lowland areas of marshy or grassy wetlands, often along river valleys, with small, shallow, often-temporary lakes and ponds. In the former Soviet Union it has been reported from steppe, forest steppe, broad-leaved and mixed leafed coniferous forests, but it also inhabits open landscapes, using drainage channels as pathways for dispersal. At the southeastern margin of its distribution, the species lives in permanent freshwater bodies in river valleys surrounded by an arid saline landscape (solonetz-solonchak complex). It is primarily an aquatic animal living in shallow (less than 50-70cm depth) stagnant lakes, ponds, pools, swamps, peat bogs, ditches, flooded rice fields and quarries. It may occasionally be found in semi-flowing waters: springs, irrigation channels, rivers and stream pools and the water must generally be clear (for example in the Carpathian region, B. bombina lives in wetlands with clearer water than the congeneric Bombina variegata); however, near the southern margin of the range (such as southeastern Ukraine and the Krasnodar Region) the species often occurs in waters that have been polluted with industrial and agricultural chemicals such as settling and sedimentation reservoirs, rice fields, polluted ponds in rural and urban areas. The species breeds by larval development in pools with a good growth of sub-aquatic vegetation. Hybrid populations of this species with B. variegata have been recorded.";;In western and northern Europe the species is threatened by the loss of habitat through modernisation of agricultural methods, most significantly the drainage and/or pollution of suitable wetland areas. Recent declines in northwestern Europe might also be related to climate change. In Turkey it is threatened by urban development and agricultural development. Within the former Soviet Union destruction of wetlands is also the most serious threat, although industrial pollution and recreational activities also impact populations. Additional localized threats to this species include mortality on roads, entrapment in open wells with vertical walls, hybridization and replacement by Bombina variegata and collection for the pet trade. However, at a global scale this species is not significantly threatened.
A6;Bombina_pachypus;The species occurs in shallow, unshaded pools in forests and open areas. Spawning and larval development takes place in these pools. It also occurs in modified habitats, such as low-intensity farmland, pastureland, ditches, irrigations areas, drinking troughs, and ponds.;, and large open areas are generally avoided;"Threats to this species are presumed to largely include loss and fragmentation of wetland habitat to drainage for intensive agricultural purposes. However many populations appear to have declined in areas of presumably intact habitat. In some places it may have very small populations (10-12 individuals [Mattoccia et al . 2005]); these small populations are highly subject to stochastic extinctions. This species might also be threatened with chytridiomycosis, which has been associated with the deaths of several captive animals (Stagni et al. , 2002; Stagni et al. 2005), and further research into the possible impacts of this disease on populations of this species is needed. The cause of recent serious population declines remains incompletely known, but it has been speculated that chytridiomycosis is responsible."
A7;Bombina_variegata;It can be found in coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests, bushlands and meadows, floodplains and grasslands. At low elevations this species lives in deciduous forests, at higher altitudes it is more often found in coniferous forests and highland glades. The species uses many types of wetland, including lakes, ponds, swamps, rivers, stream pools, springs (including mineral and thermal springs), puddles, reservoirs, gravel and clay pits, ditches and even water filled wheel ruts. The breeding habitats are typically unshaded temporary pools within, or close to, woodland. The species can tolerate slight water pollution, and has been recorded at very high densities in areas of cleared woodland in the Carpathian Mountains. This species regularly hybridizes with B. bombina in many contact areas.;;At a global scale, the species appears not to be significantly threatened. Populations of this species might be locally threatened by the loss of suitable habitat to urbanization, road construction, industry (including oil extraction and transportation) and discharge of pollutants into wetlands. Additionally, it is reported that it is collected as bait by fishermen in certain regions and that it is occasionally collected in large numbers for both the pet trade and scientific use. The impact of collection on this species needs further research. Some artificial habitats where the species occurs (e.g. gravel and clay pits) are threatened by succession. Hybridization with B. bombina might also be considered a threat, at least in some areas. Mosaic hybridization in Transylvania has resulted in the loss of pure populations (Vines 2004).
A8;Bufo_bufo;This is a widespread and adaptable species present in coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests, groves, bushlands, meadows, arid areas, parks and gardens. It is usually in damp areas with dense vegetation. The species spawns and larval development takes place in still waters and slow-moving parts of rivers and streams. It is present in many modified habitats.;;There are generally no major threats to this widespread and common species. Populations might be locally impacted through deforestation, drainage of wetlands, pollution, agricultural intensification, urbanization, desertification, mortality on roads (migrating animals), and persecution. In parts of the former Soviet Union it is collected in small numbers for the pet trade. This species can be affected by the increase of UV-B radiation (Lizana and Pedraza 1998). Relict populations in montane areas in Lebanon might be threatened by the impacts of global warming. Chytridiomycosis is a potential threat to the species and has been reported in some Spanish and UK populations. It has declined extensively in Spain due to habitat loss and aridity. One subspecies in Spain, B.b. gredosicola , is threatened by predation by otters and competition with the frog Rana perezi , both of which appear to have moved into higher altitudes as a result of climatic warming. In the United Kingdom the species is increasingly suffering from habitat fragmentation and some unexplained declines have occurred.
A9;Epidalea_calamita;"This species is generally found in open and unshaded light sandy soils of coastal dunes, lowland heaths, semi-desert, high mountains, pine forest glades, gardens, parks, agricultural fields, sand and gravel quarries and meadows. In the daytime these animals hide in heaps of stones, in sandy soil and under debris. Spawning, followed by a short larval development period, takes place in sunny shallow temporary pools and lagoons. This is a pioneering species in much of southern Europe, sometimes temporarily colonizing new ponds; it is very much less adaptable in northern Europe.";;"The main threats to this species are loss of specialized habitats (such as heaths and dunes) by natural encroachment of scrub and woodland; afforestation, acidification of breeding pools, agricultural development, infilling of breeding sites (such as temporary pools and sand and gravel quarries); increased mechanization of sand and gravel extraction and infrastructure development for tourism. In some parts of its range (e.g. in UK and Spain) chytridiomycosis is a threat. The species is considered vulnerable to climate change, particularly in southern Europe."
A100;Bufotes_balearica;"It is generally a lowland species. It occupies coastal areas (typically but not exclusively sand dunes), cultivated areas, and suburban and urban areas where it is found in gravel and sand pits, ponds and ditches; also in water tanks in the Balearic Islands.";;In the Balearic Islands, loss and degradation of breeding habitat has resulted from excessive water abstraction, urbanization, decline of traditional agricultural practices and pollution with agrochemicals. Fragmentation as a result of road construction is also a problem.
A101;Bufotes_boulengeri;This species is found as often fragmented populations in forested areas, scrubland, dry grassland, semi-deserts and deserts. It inhabits both wetland areas as well as different dry desert types (usually found close to oases). It is presumably able to adapt to some habitat modification, especially where irrigation schemes increase the availability of suitable spawning habitats.;;The main threat over much of the range appears to be the loss of breeding habitats through wetland drainage, desiccation and aquatic pollution (industrial and agricultural).
A102;Bufotes_sicula;It is generally a lowland species. It occupies coastal areas (typically but not exclusively sand dunes), cultivated areas, and suburban and urban areas where it is found in gravel and sand pits, ponds and ditches.;;Habitat fragmentation as a result of road construction is a threat. Loss of breeding habitat as a result of water abstraction may also be a problem. The species is, however, not considered to be seriously threatened at present.
A103;Bufotes_variabilis;Although additional details of natural history are needed for populations recognized as Pseudepidalea variabilis , it seems plausible that it can be found in similar habitats to those populations indicated by Stöck et al . (2006) as belonging to Pseudepidalea viridis , including grassland, meadows and steppe habitats, forests and shrubland, and a range of wetland areas or waterbodies. The isolated Kavir Desert population is restricted to the area of a single brackish spring and surrounding grassland within this highly arid environment.;;The threats to the species are poorly known, but in view of the widely reported distribution for Pseudepidalea variabilis it is probable that there are no overall major threats. The key threats to this species in parts of its range are likely to be similar to that of Pseudepidalea viridis , namely the loss (for instance through agricultural expansion) or degradation (pollution) of wetland breeding habitats. The Kavir Desert population is found in an extremely remote area, although there are buildings of the Game Guard Post surrounding the single spring. Although there are no current threats to this population, it is plausible that any alteration of the stream flow (for example through the creation of watering troughs for game animals) could lead to the rapid decline of this morphologically distinct population.
A11;Bufotes_viridis;This species lives in a wide range of forests, forest steppe, scrubland, grassland and alpine habitats. Animals may be present in modified areas including urban centres (e.g. Bucharest), city parks and gardens - and often benefits from disturbed habitats. Spawning and larval development occurs in a diverse range of temporary and permanent waterbodies including swamps, ponds, lakes, pools in streams and rivers, reservoirs, ditches and puddles.;;The main threat over much of the range (most especially in the north) appears to be the loss of breeding habitats through wetland drainage, desiccation and aquatic pollution (industrial and agricultural). Populations might be locally declining mortality on roads.
A21;Hyla_arborea;This species is generally associated with open, well-illuminated broad-leaved and mixed forests, bush and shrublands, meadows, gardens, vineyards, orchards, parks, lake shores and low riparian vegetation. Populations can tolerate periods of dryness and can be encountered in dry habitats (Dan Cogălniceanu pers. comm., October 2008). Spawning and larval development takes place in stagnant waters such as lakes, ponds, swamps and reservoirs, and sometimes in ditches and puddles. The species has been reported from anthropogenic landscapes, including large cities (e.g., Kiev). It sometimes occurs in sympatry with Hyla meridionalis (and produces infertile hybrids).;Dark and dense forests are avoided. ;The species is quite sensitive to changes in habitat, including loss and fragmentation of forests, bush groves and meadows (with the isolation of populations), and the drainage and pollution of wetlands (industrial and agricultural) and predatory fish species. These impacts on metapopulations have led to declines in parts of Europe, and possible local declines in Turkey. The species is collected for the pet trade, and in some parts of its range (western Europe) this might be leading to local population declines.
A22;Hyla_intermedia;"It is usually associated with lowland woodland and forest; also found in some wetland habitats (e.g. reedbeds). It breeds in standing waters (lakes, small stagnant ponds, water tanks). The species is sometimes found in modified habitats (e.g. rice fields).";;The species is potentially threatened by local habitat loss to urbanization and water pollution (presumably by agrochemicals). But overall, it is not seriously threatened.
A23;Hyla_meridionalis;"This species may be found in trees, shrubs, orchards, vineyards, and grasses generally near to freshwater habitats; the species can occur at high densities within suitable vegetation. Breeding and larval development take place in ponds, springs, irrigation ditches, temporary pools, flooded meadows, lagoons, cattle pools, wells and even swimming pools. It is sympatric in some areas with Hyla arborea (and produces infertile hybrids).";;"The species is locally threatened by terrestrial habitat loss (intensification of agriculture; infrastructure development), aquatic pollution (agriculture; mosquito control), and loss of breeding sites (e.g.. drinking troughs). The introduction of predatory Louisiana Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ), and fishes (such as Gambusia holbrooki ) to breeding sites is a serious threat to this species. The species appears to show a greater resilience to eutrophication than many other species, possibly as the eutrophic waters promote the growth of reed mace and other favorable vegetation."
A24;Hyla_sarda;This species is found within the vicinity of pools, ponds and streams, usually in woody areas. In residential areas they can be found in gardens, as long as there is nearby water. It reproduces in springs, cisterns and other suitable waterbodies.;;There are no significant threats to this species at present.
A25;Hyla_savignyi;The species lives in much drier landscapes than Hyla arborea , including steppes, deserts and semi-deserts. It is also present in gardens, bush lands, montane forest edges, open oak and juniper forests, and areas with permanent or semi permanent water sources (including oasis) with good surrounding vegetation (e.g.. Phragmites , Oleander). The species may be found at considerable distances from waterbodies in xeric environments, such as rocky slopes and on the xerophytic bush Alhagi pseudoalhagi . Spawning and larval development takes place in small stagnant waterbodies, drainage canals and slow flowing brooks with dense herbaceous and shrub vegetation. The species is able to adapt to light habitat modification, and may be found in rural, or semi-urban, areas where suitable wetland habitat exists.;;Severe drought, drying from water extraction, overgrazing and habitat loss might lead to localized declines. In Syrian Arab Republic and the Arabian Peninsula it might be threatened by water pollution and anthropogenic changes of habitat. In Israel, available breeding sites have declined by up to 30% in recent years.
A36;Pelobates_cultripes;The burrowing habits of this species generally restrict its distribution to areas with sandy or soft soils. It occurs in dunes, oak forest, scrub, cultivated land, and open areas, sometimes close to human habitation. In France it is largely restricted to coastal regions. It breeds in temporary pools and livestock ponds with thick vegetation that occasionally may be brackish. This species has a long larval development period, which makes it vulnerable to introduced predators and desiccation of ponds.;;In Iberia threats include the isolation of populations by agricultural intensification, destruction of wetland habitats (by urban development) and their pollution (with agrochemicals), and introduction of predatory Louisiana crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) and fish (such as Gambusia holbrooki ) to breeding areas. Mortality on roads, and tourism development, are causing localized declines in some populations. In France, tourism and wetland drainage are the principal threats to this species. Overall, the severity of the threats to this species appears to be increasing.
A37;Pelobates_fuscus;It is mostly present in open areas. It inhabits clear spaces in coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests (and their edges), groves, steppes, fields, meadows, sand dunes, heath land, gravel pits, parks and gardens. Spawning sites are mostly permanent, small still waterbodies including ditches, ponds and lakes. It may occur in modified habitats such as rice fields (in Italy). Nocturnal and habitat specific.;, generally avoiding moist soils;"The species seems to be may be sensitive to water quality and soil structure. Pollution of wetlands by industry, domestic sewage and agriculture (including eutrophication), drainage of breeding pools and introduction of predatory fishes and crayfish are major threats to the species. The species is also threatened by loss of terrestrial habitats (such as meadows) by factors such as intensive agriculture (e.g., over-stocking of cattle) and mortality on roads (and off-road driving). The species is collected in small numbers for the pet trade.

 Pelobates fuscus insubricus is a highly threatened subspecies. There are now 12 populations and in recent years it has declined strongly. In some areas it is threatened by the introduced crayfish. chytrid may be a problem (and may be now) in the near future. There is an Action Plan for this species in the Bern Convention."
A38;Pelobates_syriacus;"It is a largely fossorial species. Terrestrial habitats occupied are generally open uncultivated lands such as light forests, steppe (and steppe-like habitats), semi-desert and rocky areas. It is generally less selective than Pelobates fuscus in terms of soil preference, inhabiting not only soft soils suitable for a fossorial life (although they are preferred), but also solid, rocky soils, particularly friable clay with pebbles. Spawning sites include stagnant temporary waterbodies; river or lakeside temporary waterbodies and large permanent pools. It can occur in slightly modified areas, including intensively grazed areas.";;It is generally threatened by habitat loss through drainage or loss of breeding wetlands and conversion of land to agricultural and industrial use. Threatened by habitat destruction (especially of breeding sites) in Jordan and Israel. In Iran it is threatened by Caspian Sea coastal development, including holiday homes and agriculture (rice). Fragmented populations are susceptible to extinction through population fluctuations, most especially within arid landscapes.
A40;Pelodytes_ibericus;It can be found in dry or slightly damp open habitats including open woods, shrubland, salt marshes and cultivated areas. It can survive in intensively farmed areas. It breeds after rain in shallow sunny ponds (up to 1.5m deep), lagoons, stream backwaters, drains, roadside ditches and possibly in salt marshes. It is present in some modified habitats (such as non-intensively farmed fields).;;Loss of suitable freshwater breeding habitats (including stream channelization) is a threat as is habitat fragmentation. Predation of larvae and adults by exotic fish and Louisiana Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) introductions is also a threat.
A41;Pelodytes_punctatus;Its preferred habitats are dry or damp stony areas (including drystone walls). It is also observed in dunes, flooded quarries and cultivated areas. It is often present in calcareous or sandy areas. Aquatic habitats, where it breeds, include shallow, sunny, open (often ephemeral or temporary) waters, small pools, ditches and slow, small streams with a sandy substrate. It can occur in traditionally farmed areas.;;Threats include drainage of marshland and canalization of rivers (Gasc et al. , 1997). Loss of suitable freshwater breeding habitats and habitat fragmentation are also threats. Intensification of agriculture is threatening the species in Iberia. Desertification is a threat in parts of its range (southern Portugal). Predation of larvae and adults by exotic fish and Louisiana Crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) introductions (especially in Iberia) is also a threat. Hydroelectric projects are leading to habitat loss in parts of Portugal.
A45;Pelophylax_bedriagae;This is a largely aquatic species of permanent wetlands with rich aquatic vegetation. The species' habitats include permanent ponds, rain pools, streams, rivers, irrigation channels, reservoirs, marshes, springs and fishponds, being sometimes found in surrounding terrestrial habitats. It is able to survive in areas with organic pollution and tributaries from hot mineral springs. It is a seasonal breeder, with breeding taking place in permanent waterbodies. This species can occur in modified habitats where suitable wetlands exist.;;It is threatened by a localized loss of habitat through the drainage of wetlands, pollution, excessive drought and the development of coastal areas. It is caught and exported from Turkey to western Europe for food which represents a significant threat. It is exported in large numbers from Egypt (S. Baha El Din pers. comm.). There are no threats to the species in Lebanon. On the smaller islands in Greece where this species is present, it is sometimes threatened by water abstraction by local people.
A46;Pelophylax_bergeri;It is associated with still and slow moving waters, where it breeds, and the surrounding terrestrial habitats. It may occasionally be found in modified habitats;;"This species is threatened by the localized loss of suitable wetland habitat (presumably through drainage for agriculture and urbanization). Pelophylax species have been widely translocated (they are eaten by people), and different species within the genus hybridize readily; consequently hybridization presents a threat to the genetic integrity of the species."
A47;Pelophylax_cerigensis;It is a mostly aquatic species, largely restricted to permanent still or slow-running waters and apparently sensitive to habitat change. Breeding and larval development presumably take place in these waterbodies.;;The major threat is habitat loss and degradation of suitable aquatic habitats. Although the site from which the species is known is fairly remote, freshwater habitats are subject to a number of threats such as excessive water abstraction and climate change. Fires are an additional potential threat, and the species may be vulnerable to climate change.
A48;Pelophylax_cretensis;It is associated with wetlands including slow-moving rivers and streams, lakes and marshes. Breeding and larval development presumably take place in these waterbodies.;;The loss of aquatic habitats is the principal threat to this species. Extraction of stream water in the uplands for agricultural irrigation (for bananas) leaves many lowland reaches dry during the summer months. Additional habitat loss may be occurring through infrastructure and tourism development. It might be impacted by the introduction of Lithobates catesbeiana .
A50;Pelophylax_epeiroticus;This species is mostly aquatic and is commonly associated with still waters, slow-moving rivers, canals, and marshes, often with rich vegetation at their edges. Breeding and larval development takes place in these waterbodies. It is not known if the species can adapt to changes in habitat.;;The main threats to this species are general loss of wetland habitat (through drainage for urbanization, tourism and agricultural intensification), water pollution, and large-scale commercial collection for food (it is harvested in enormous numbers in Albania).
A51;Pelophylax_esculentus;It is a largely aquatic species associated with wetlands such as ponds, channels, ditches and slow moving rivers and streams.  The species spawns and larval development takes place within wetland habitats. It can occur in artificial waterbodies, and has spread in parts of its range through the irrigation of formerly unsuitable habitat (e.g.. in parts of Romania).;It is generally absent from forests, very large pools and strongly flowing waterbodies.;"It is generally threatened by aquatic pollution (often by agrochemicals) and drainage of wetland habitats. The frog-leg trade and high levels of pollution are leading to significant declines in populations of the former Yugoslavia (Dzukic, 1996; Ljubisavljevic et al. 2003). Declines in the parent species R. lessonae can directly affect dependant populations of R. esculenta ."
A53;Pelophylax_grafi; Rana grafi occurs in mixed colonies with R. perezi , and lives in similar habitat, being found in a wide variety of temporary and permanent waterbodies (such as pools, streams, ditches, and irrigation canals), where it breeds. Terrestrial habitats include forests, scrubland, agricultural areas and coastal marshes.;;The major threat to this species is displacement by the invasive species P. ridibundus . It is possibly also threatened by the drainage of suitable wetlands for agricultural, urban and tourism development. Agrochemical pollution of breeding waterbodies is also presumed to be a threat.
A54;Pelophylax_hispanicus;It is associated with still and slow moving waters and is found in nearby terrestrial habitats. This species is usually found in mixed colonies with Pelophylax bergeri . It can occur in slightly modified habitats.;;"This species is threatened by the localized loss of suitable wetland habitat (presumably through drainage for agriculture and urbanization). It might also be threatened through predation by introduced fish. Pelophylax species have been widely translocated (they are eaten by people), and different species within the genus hybridize readily; consequently hybridization presents a threat to the genetic integrity of the species."
A57;Pelophylax_kurtmuelleri;It is a largely aquatic species, generally found in areas close to suitable open water wetland habitats. It breeds in various stagnant and slow-moving waterbodies. Introduced populations of this species in Italy do not form hybridogenetic hybrids with native species (T. Uzzell pers. comm.).;;This species is threatened in its native range by drainage of wetland habitats and aquatic pollution of many waterways caused by agrochemical and industrial (including mining) contaminants. In northern parts of its native range (e.g., Lake Skadar) it is significantly threatened by over collection for commercial purposes. The species is additionally threatened by accidental introductions of commercially transported non-native water frogs. However, it remains abundant in many places.
A59;Pelophylax_lessonae;It is present in deciduous and mixed forests, forest steppe, steppe, bush lands (e.g. riparian alder groves), meadows, fields and fens. It may often be found in shallow stagnant waterbodies (usually without fish) such as lakes, ponds, swamps, large puddles, clay and gravel pits, and ditches, often covered with dense herbaceous vegetation. It breeds in these wetlands, but may be found hibernating away from waterbodies. It is not very adaptable, but can occur in slightly modified habitats.;;"It is threatened by habitat loss through agricultural intensification and urbanization, channelization of waterbodies, drainage and pollution of wetlands, and the introduction of predatory fishes to breeding sites. It is additionally threatened by afforestation (in northern parts of the range) and competition with the larger sympatric R. ridibunda. The frog-leg trade (which is increasing) and high levels of pollution are leading to significant declines in populations within Yugoslavia (Dzukic, 1996; Ljubisavljevic et al. 2003)."
A61;Pelophylax_perezi;It inhabits a wide variety of temporary and permanent waterbodies (pools, streams, ditches, irrigation canals etc.). The terrestrial habitats of the species include forests, Mediterranean-type scrub, agricultural areas, rocky areas, coastal marshes, gardens and urban parks. It breeds in various aquatic habitats, and is able to tolerate some habitat disturbance.;;There are generally no major threats to this widespread species. localized threats include changes in habitat through the loss of traditional agricultural methods, drainage or pollution of wetlands, collection of individuals for human consumption and hybridization with introduced farmed European ranids (R. esculenta complex). Mortality of the species through disease (iridovirus) has been recorded in Carris Lake, Peneda-Gerês National Park, Portugal. The disease might be non-native and have been transferred to the lake by an introduced predatory North American fish ( Lepomis gibbosus ). Predation by Lepomis gibbosus and other introduced predatory fish species occurs but is probably not a threat, and it is not greatly threatened in Portugal by the expansion of non-native predatory crayfish (Beja pers. comm.). In France, it is being displaced within some of its range by the introduced species Pelophylax ridibunda .
A63;Pelophylax_ridibundus;"It is a highly opportunistic amphibian, living in mixed and deciduous forests, forest steppe, and steppe and other grasslands, semi-desert and desert zones. Arid areas are largely colonized through river valleys and channels. The frog prefers open, well-warmed areas with abundant herbaceous vegetation. It is a semi-aquatic species, inhabiting (and breeding in) a wide variety of flowing and stagnant water habitats, from shallow puddles and ponds to large lakes, reservoirs, rivers and brooks. It may also be found in slightly saline water; on the northern shore of the Apsheron Peninsula (Caspian Sea), reproduction has been observed in marine water at a distance of 0.5-1m from the shore. It is present in many modified habitats.";;"There are no major threats to this adaptable species. Loss of breeding habitats may lead to localized declines, but it is very resistant to environmental pollution and animals may be found in highly polluted waters (such as chemical or metallurgic pollution) where other amphibian species cannot survive. Severe, or prolonged, droughts may lead to localized population declines of this frog in arid areas. The harvesting of this species for educational and medical research, or food, appears to have little effect on some populations, although the frog-leg trade and high levels of pollution are leading to significant declines in populations in eastern Asia, in the former Yugoslavia (Dzukic, 1996; Ljubisavljevic et al. 2003) and possibly also in Romania. In Turkey, the harvesting of frog populations allocated to Pelophylax ridibunda for food appears to be a threat, thus the frog-leg trade and very significant levels of pollution due to some industrial areas might be leading to significant declines in populations in Turkey."
A64;Pelophylax_shqipericus;It has been reported from heavily vegetated aquatic habitats including ditches, swamps, marshes, the edges of slow-flowing rivers and the shoreline of Lake Skadar. Breeding, and larval development, takes place in these wetland habitats. It is not known if the species can successfully adapt to habitat modification.;;The major threat is drainage of wetland habitats and aquatic pollution of many waterways caused by agrochemical and industrial (including mining) contaminants. In the northern parts of its range (e.g. Lake Skadar) it is significantly threatened by over collection for commercial purposes. An additional threat is the accidental introduction of commercially transported non-native water frogs.
A44;Rana_arvalis;It occurs in a wide variety of habitats including tundra, forest tundra, forest, forest steppe, steppe, forest edges and glades, semi-desert, swamps, peatlands, moorlands, meadows, fields, bush lands, gardens. It has a breeding season, and spawning and larval development takes place in various stagnant water bodies of low acidity, including lakes, ponds, swamps, puddles and ditches. There is some evidence that the species can occur in agricultural landscapes, and in some areas it appears to be adapting to urban conditions (e.g.. Vershinin, 1997).;;It is threatened by the destruction and pollution of breeding ponds (including acidification) and adjacent wetland and terrestrial habitats, especially through urbanization, recreation, tourism, industry and overstocking of cattle. Additional threats are prolonged drought and predation of spawn by waterfowl. Chytrid fungus was detected in this species in Berlin, Germany - however the extent to which this is a threat is unknown.
A49;Rana_dalmatina;It is found in glades and open sites within light deciduous woodland (oak, beech, hornbeam etc.), and less frequent in meadows and thickets. It generally it does not occur in pasture, arable areas or coniferous forests. In Spain the species is restricted to Quercus pedunculata oak forest, and is associated with wet meadows. It spawns in small wetlands (pools, fens and marshes, ditches) within forests and at their edges. High levels of larval mortality have been recorded.;;It is generally threatened by the drainage and eutrophication of breeding sites, development (and logging) of suitable habitat, and replacement of deciduous forest habitat with unsuitable coniferous species. It is locally threatened by road mortality during breeding migrations. Grossenbacher (in Krone et al. , 1997) reported skin diseases (possibly associated with viral infection) in populations from Switzerland and northern Italy that are potentially related to declines and may be related to polluted water. It is experiencing localized declines in southwestern Europe.
A52;Rana_graeca;This is a largely aquatic, montane species associated with cold small clear rivers, streams and springs often located in shady deciduous and mixed forest. It may also occur in moors and meadows, and around glacial pools in lakes. Breeding and larval development takes place in these waterbodies. It is presumed that the species can tolerate some slight habitat modification.;;The major threat to this species is the loss of suitable habitat, resulting from forest fires, wetland drainage, construction of dams, etc. It is also affected in some places by pollution.
A55;Rana_iberica;This is an aquatic species usually found in shady habitats (with abundant vegetation) close to rivers, streams, lakes and marshes. The species' terrestrial habitats include woods, moors, meadows and areas of low scrub. In the north of its range it can occur down to sea level along slower flowing rivers. Breeding and larval development takes place within various shallow stagnant waterbodies.;;Threats to this species include pressure from tourism development, urbanization of the lowland range, habitat loss through intensification of agriculture and deforestation and re-afforestation with non-native monocultures, introduction of non-native predatory fishes (salmonids) and mammals such as Neovison vison (American mink), desertification in southern Portugal, and habitat loss through hydroelectric projects. Recreational use by people of its habitats may cause disturbance to the species.
A56;Rana_italica;It is a mostly montane species associated with fast flowing streams that have a rocky substrate. It may also be found in small ponds or mountain peat bogs. It also occurs in some man-made habitats such as water troughs.;;The main threats to this species are the loss of stream habitats and aquatic pollution presumably through agriculture and urbanization, and also predation by introduced salmonid fishes.
A58;Rana_latastei;"The original habitat of this species is semi-hygrophilous forest; in secondary habitats it is associated with humid deciduous wooded areas, typically situated alongside small streams, rivers, or lakes, with rich vegetation. It is present in poplar plantations with thick understorey and occasionally meadows (Arnold 2002). It hibernates on land (where it may occur up to a kilometre from water: Arnold 2002), and also under the mud of stream beds. The species breeds in permanent and temporary water in wooded areas, usually including slow-moving rivers. It can occur in anthropogenic habitats such as agricultural irrigation ditches, but only if these are close to forest remnants for over wintering (Garner pers. comm.).";;This species is threatened by the destruction of much of the original humid deciduous forests of the Padano Venetian plain and Istrian region by extensive agricultural development including drainage and deforestation (with population fragmentation). Additional threats to this species are the introduction of predatory fishes and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii) , lowering of the water table, and aquatic pollution. Crayfish predation has driven one isolated subpopulation to disappear. The reduced genetic diversity in western populations might be leading to greater vulnerability to emergent pathogens (T. Garner pers. comm.).
A62;Rana_pyrenaica;It lives in and close to rocky mountain streams and torrents in which the water is cold, clear and well oxygenated, and is also found in roadside and forest edge ditches, drinking troughs and rain pools. Breeding takes place in these waterbodies.;;Threats include stream eutrophication (through intensification of agricultural practices), drought, potential introduction of trout and other predatory fishes, and habitat loss due to the development of tourism and transport infrastructure. Logging and associated activities may threaten the species' habitat, and it is likely to be vulnerable to climate change.
A66;Rana_temporaria;"Many terrestrial (associated with woodland) and aquatic habitat types are used. Present in coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests, forested tundra and steppe, bush and shrublands, glades, grasslands, dry and wet meadows, marshes, fields, rural gardens, parks, and urban areas. Aquatic habitats include both temporary and permanent ponds, lakes and rivers; spawning and larval development occurs in these waterbodies. It does well in many modified habitats such as rural gardens.";;"There are no major threats to this species. The main localized threat is the general pollution and drainage of breeding sites and wetlands. Over collection for medical research, food and commercial purposes is a threat in parts of its range. Deforestation might have led to a gradual ""northward retreat"" of the species over southern parts of its distribution. Overcollection for medical research has been a threat in the past, however the extent to which it is a current threat is unknown."
A77;Speleomantes_genei;It is found in humid rocky outcrops, caves, crevices, and forested areas in the vicinity of streams. The species reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;The major threat is general deforestation of suitable habitat, mineral extraction, urbanization, and over-collection of specimens, presumably for scientific purposes.
A75;Speleomantes_ambrosii;It is known from humid rocky outcrops, caves, crevices, and forested areas in the vicinity of streams. Individuals may occasionally be found climbing in vegetation. The species reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;Threats to this species include general localized loss of suitable habitat and illegal collection.
A76;Speleomantes_flavus;The species is found in damp mountain regions, rocky outcrops, caves, crevices, and forested areas in the vicinity of streams. The preferred habitat often has a good covering of damp moss. It reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;There are no threats identified other than some localized loss of habitat and illegal collection. However, these threats are limited, and it is not believed to be significantly threatened.
A78;Speleomantes_imperialis;This species is found in humid rocky outcrops, caves, crevices, and forested areas in the vicinity of streams. It reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;There are no major threats identified other than general localized habitat loss and illegal collection.
A79;Speleomantes_italicus;This species is known from humid rocky outcrops, caves, crevices, and forested areas in the vicinity of streams, often in limestone areas. It reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;There are no major threats identified other than some localized habitat loss and illegal collection.
A80;Speleomantes_sarrabusensis;"This species is found in a granitic, almost caveless area, in humid rocky outcrops, crevices, and forested areas.
It possibly reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs but there is some evidence that it might be a live-bearing species.";;The only known population is in a protected area, so there are not any obvious direct threats to its habitat. However, the species is intrinsically at risk because of its tiny range, and through illegal collection.
A81;Speleomantes_strinatii;It is found in the vicinity of streams and seepages, and amongst rocky outcrops and caves in mountainous areas. It reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;There are no major threats identified other than localized loss of habitat and illegal collection.
A82;Speleomantes_supramontis;The species is found in humid rocky outcrops, limestone caves, crevices, and forested areas with a good growth of moss in the vicinity of streams. It reproduces through the direct development of a few terrestrial eggs.;;It is generally threatened by localized habitat loss and illegal collection.
A43;Proteus_anguinus;"The species generally occurs in large subterranean aquatic karst systems formed in limestone and dolomite rocks, and may be found in cave entrances (especially during episodes of high rainfall and flooding) and abandoned mine workings. Many of the caves that the species occurs in are connected to rivers that run above ground for the first 50-100km and then disappear into the ground. Populations may be found close to the surface or as much as 300m underground depending on the thickness of the Karstic formation. The species is found in waters ranging from 5°C to 15°C. Animals feed on detritus and endemic cave invertebrates and hide in crevices or bottom sediment when disturbed. In contrast to the nominate subspecies, P. a. parkelj is found in warmer surface waters. The species is long-lived (they are not sexually mature until they are 12 years of age) and reproduce very slowly. Females lay approximately 70 individual eggs on the undersides of aquatic stones; however, in some cases the eggs are retained within the body and two fully formed young are produced.";;The main threats to this species are changes to the forested and pastoral land above the subterranean systems, largely through tourism, economic changes, and increasing water pollution. These changes have a direct influence on the quality of the habitat available to the species. The species is highly dependent on clean water, and is therefore very susceptible to pollution. Other localized threats to this species might include water abstraction and hydroelectric schemes. There is some illegal collection of this species for the pet trade, but the extent of this is unknown.
A99;Calotriton_arnoldi;It lives in oligotrophic, cold (below 15°C) fast running waters, preferentially in beech forest ( Fagus sylvatica ) but also in holm oak forest ( Quercus ilex ), with patches of Algnus glutinosa (Carranza and Amat 2005). Neither juvenile nor adult C. arnoldi have been found on land (Carranza and Amat 2005). If this behaviour is confirmed, the only way that contact among populations could occur is by moving down one watercourse and then up other tributaries of the same river system. It therefore seems possible that there is a considerable degree of isolation between the populations.;;The drying out of mountain streams is the most immediate threat to this species. Large amounts of water are being extracted from El Montseny, and this is bottled and sold widely Spain and Europe. As a result, El Montseny is drying out and the distribution of Calotriton arnoldi is being reduced dramatically. The low population size of the species could also be due to past human alteration of its original habitat (Carranza and Amat 2005). The species might also be affected by global warming. For instance, the beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) forest, an excellent habitat for C. arnoldi , has shifted upwards by 70m at the highest altitudes (1,600–1,700m asl) since 1945, and is being replaced by holm oak ( Quecus ilex ) forest at lower altitudes (800–1400 m) (Peñuelas and Boada 2003). In other words, the most favoured woodland habitat of the species is moving up into areas where the streams are drying out.
A18;Calotriton_asper;It is a largely aquatic montane species that inhabits cold mountain lakes, torrents, streams, and occasionally cave systems, that are ice-free for at least four months of the year (Griffiths 1996). The eggs are deposited individually under rocks and stones in well-oxygenated, cold streams with rocky bottoms, and the larvae then develop in these streams. This species has a small clutch size of 20-40 eggs (Griffiths 1996).;;The main threats to this species are loss and damage of its aquatic habitats. Infrastructure development and tourism lead to over-exploitation of water resources, including from skiing facilities. The introduction of predatory trout (salmonids) and other fish is also a threat, leading to population extinctions, especially in mountain lakes. Pesticides are readily accumulated in the body tissues of this largely insectivorous species, and several populations demonstrate contamination by these chemicals (Gasc et al. (eds.) 1997). It is considered likely to be vulnerable to climate change.
A12;Chioglossa_lusitanica;The species is associated with clear, well-oxygenated, small- to medium-sized slightly acidic streams (although in Portugal it has been found in water with pH 7-8), with dense surrounding vegetation in mountainous and hilly areas. The species has also been recorded from caves and abandoned flooded mines. It is associated with broad-leaved oak forest, and occurs in secondary vegetation, but not usually in commercial plantations. Animals have been recorded from eucalypt plantations, pine forests and even shrubland ( Taxus or Erica ) (Iñigo Martínez-Solano pers. comm. December, 2008). The females lay approximately 12-20 eggs in shallow stream water, often attaching the eggs to the bottom substrate. It is often associated with areas of traditional farming practices, and is particularly found in dry stonewalls. Some populations in north-western Spain have disappeared following replacement of broad-leaved forest with other habitats.;;The major threats to the species are pollution of streams with agrochemicals, canalization, and water extraction from streams for agricultural purposes, and the loss of terrestrial habitats associated with the streams through conversion to forestry plantations ( Eucalyptus and Pinus plantations). In Portugal, habitat is at risk from fire.
A19;Euproctus_montanus;"The aquatic habitats of this species are exclusively unpolluted small rivers, mountain rivers and lakes; it is most often found in calm sections where there is a high-water level. The terrestrial habitats of the species are generally open riverine macchia or woodland. It breeds in water, with approximately 70 eggs laid in groups under rocks. It is not considered to be very adaptable to changes in habitat.";;Threats to this species include habitat fragmentation, the introduction of predatory fishes (e.g.. trout) to streams, water pollution and the over extraction of water for both agriculture and tourism. However, it is not believed to be significantly threatened at present.
A20;Euproctus_platycephalus;"It is a montane species of permanent and temporary stagnant and running waters, which prefers calm areas of small or large rivers. Its terrestrial habitats are generally restricted to riverine scrub or woodland, and the species may also be found in cave systems. Its breeding sites are permanent pools, water holes, small lakes and streams. The eggs are deposited between stones or are buried in sand; the larvae develop in the streams (Griffiths 1996; Rimpp 1998). The species is quite adaptable and can be found in artificial pools.";;The major threats to the species are pollution of waterbodies, habitat fragmentation, predation by introduced trout, and prolonged drought (often caused by excessive water abstraction). During the 1950s, many populations were lost through the application of DDT to waterbodies. Recently, the Gola di Gorroppu population has become threatened through damage to its habitat caused by tourist activities. At least one population is known to be affected by chytridiomycosis and is declining.
A84;Lissotriton_boscai;This is a largely aquatic species, with vegetated shallow ponds and streams being the preferred habitat. It may also be found in cattle troughs, lagoons, streams and deep still waters, and is frequently found in temporary ponds. Animals have also been recorded from irrigation channels and other human-made ephemeral or permanent structures (C. Ayres, pers. comm.). The species occupies a diverse range of terrestrial habitats including eucalyptus plantations, pine groves, open Oak ( Quercus ) woodland, scrub and sandy coastal areas. The species may be found in traditionally farmed areas.;;The species is mostly threatened by the loss of breeding pools caused by drainage for agriculture and urbanization. Some mortality in this species through disease (iridovirus) has been recorded in Carris Lake, Peneda-Gerês National Park, Portugal. This disease might be non-native and is thought to have been transferred to the lake by an introduced predatory fish ( Lepomis gibbosus ). Predation by introduced fish and other introduced species (such as crayfish [ Procambarus clarkii ] and mink [ Mustela vison ]) is also a threat to L. boscai . However, in much of its range, the species is resistant and its populations are stable.
A88;Lissotriton_helveticus;It is present in a variety of habitats including marshes, heathlands, moorlands, forests (where it may be very common), pastures and agricultural land. Breeding and larval development takes place in a wide variety of small stagnant waters (including very small and acidic ponds, ditches and ruts), or (rarely) slow-moving waters. The species is generally less abundant in cultivated areas, but it can survive in some anthropogenic habitats such as gardens. Its habitat preferences vary in different parts of its range.;;The species is locally threatened by general drainage, pollution and eutrophication of breeding pools, abandonment of traditional farming practices and the introduction of predatory fishes and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) (and possibly non-native vegetation). Desertification is a threat in southern parts of the range. However, through most of its range, populations are stable and abundant.
A89;Lissotriton_italicus;This species is often associated with woodland and agricultural habitats. It breeds in a variety of temporary ponds, ditches, slow-moving streams and lakes. It is also found in modified habitats such as wells and water tanks.;;The main threat to the species is localized drainage of wetlands. Pollution and eutrophication of aquatic habitats (especially breeding ponds), and the introduction of predatory fishes, may also be a problem. However, the species is not considered seriously threatened at present.
A92;Lissotriton_montandoni;"It can be found in wet and shaded coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests (consisting of beech, alder, pine, oak etc.), their edges and meadow glades; also sub alpine areas. Reproduction and larval development in almost all temporary and permanent water sources in the Carpathians including lakes, ponds, swamps, springs, puddles, ditches, overgrown stream pools and even wheel ruts in country roads. It may be present in modified habitats, even polluted waters (Arnold 2002).";;Some populations have declined due to habitat destruction (logging and infrastructure development), introduction of predatory fish species and pollution of habitats by domestic sewage. Collection of newts for education, science and the pet trade has negatively impacted some populations. It is affected by hybridization with L. vulgaris , as the range of L. vulgaris is generally spreading in the region with ongoing deforestation.
A95;Lissotriton_vulgaris;"It is generally associated with woodland habitats, including deciduous, coniferous, mixed forests and dry forests and woodlands. This is an adaptable species also present in meadows, bushlands, parks, fruit gardens, many damp habitats and rural and urban areas. The species breeds in still and slow moving shallow waters and irrigation ditches; females lay 200-300 eggs. It is often recorded from modified habitats. Several hybrids with L. helveticus have been reported while hybridization with L. montandoni is quite common in syntopic populations";;There are no major threats to this species. localized threats to the species include general drainage, pollution and eutrophication of breeding sites, logging of forest surrounding breeding pools and the introduction of predatory fishes. In the former Soviet Union there is mass commercial collecting of this species for the pet trade. Within Turkey, construction and building along the Black Sea coastline might be impacting northern Turkish populations.
A31;Lyciasalamandra_helverseni;It lives in Mediterranean rocky shrubby vegetation. It is viviparous, giving birth to fully developed young on land, and it is not associated with water.;;No major threats are known, though local populations might be impacted by loss of habitat. Harvesting for the international pet trade takes place, but not at a level sufficient to threaten the species.
A32;Lyciasalamandra_luschani;"It is associated with rocky limestone outcrops, and is often found in marquis scrub or pine woodlands (and not in modified habitats). The species is viviparous, producing one or two fully metamorphosed young; the gestation period is about one year.";;Within its naturally restricted range, the species is potentially threatened by habitat loss caused by forest fires, and overcollection for scientific purposes. Currently, there is only limited habitat loss taking place, since the human population in its range is generally low, and there is little tourism in the area where it is found, but with ongoing development in the region habitat loss could become more severe.
A83;Ichthyosaura_alpestris;This is a very aquatic species generally found close to water. It is widespread in both alpine and lowland habitats including wet, shaded coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests, sub alpine meadows and pastureland. The species breeds, and larval development takes place, in all stagnant waters including shallow ponds, temporary pools, lakes, and ditches, drinking troughs, ruts and sometimes slow-moving streams. The generation time is between 2 and 10 years depending on the locality. The species life expectancy might be more than 20 years, but is usually around 7 years. Several dozens to hundreds of eggs are deposited per female each year. Neotenous populations occur in some areas, for example mountain lakes of Slovenia, Bosnia and Montenegro. The species can be found in slightly modified habitats, although it is less common in large cultivated fields.;;"This species is vulnerable to fish introduction and breeding habitat destruction (drainage of wetlands and aquatic pollution) throughout its range. Following fish introductions, most populations rapidly become extinct (particularly alternative paedomorphic populations); some taxa (if taxonomy justified) have disappeared following fish introductions (e.g., M.a. lacustris : M. Denoël pers. comm.). In some areas there is over collection of the species for use in education and science (this has led to the extinction of the species from some Ukrainian localities). It is also collected in small numbers for the commercial pet trade (especially M.a. inexpectatus of Calabria). Populations in the Pelopenese and southeastern continental Greece are facing severe habitat loss. At least one of the introduced populations in the UK harbours chytridiomycosis, threatening native amphibian populations in the area."
A42;Pleurodeles_waltl;This is a highly aquatic species of Mediterranean-type habitats including scrub, open woodland and cultivated land. It is generally found in ponds, dayas, wadis, lakes, ditches and slow-moving streams (often temporary in nature) with plenty of vegetation cover. The adults are mostly found under stones or in mud in their aquatic habitats, or sheltering under cover on land if the wetland dries up. It may be present in slightly modified aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The female deposits around 800-1,500 eggs on plants and stones in ponds.;;This species is generally threatened through loss of aquatic habitats through drainage, agrochemical pollution, the impacts of livestock (in North African dayas), eutrophication, domestic and industrial contamination, and infrastructure development. It has largely disappeared from coastal areas in Iberia and Morocco close to concentrations of tourism and highly populated areas (such as Madrid). Introduced fish and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) are known to prey on the eggs and larvae of this species, and are implicated in its decline. Mortality on roads has been reported to be a serious threat to some populations.
A67;Salamandra_atra;"It is found in cool, damp alpine meadows, stony pastures, dwarf heath and mixed, broadleaf and coniferous woodland. Animals are usually hidden below stones and logs, but can be encountered in shady places, or after rain, during the day. The species is unusual in that it has a ovi-viviparous method of reproduction by which it gives birth on land to an average of two fully metamorphosed offspring; the gestation period is between two and four years. It may be found in pastureland and other slightly modified habitats. It is not associated with water.";;There are generally no threats to the Italian populations of S.a. atra. Some local populations in Switzerland are threatened by road mortality and populations of the Dinaric Alps are threatened by localized habitat destruction through intensification of farming methods, tourism (skiing) and infrastructure development. The subspecies S.a. aurorae is threatened by collection for scientific purposes and the pet trade and general habitat alteration through excessive water abstraction from streams, and the removal of ground cover during forestry practices. Populations in Serbia and Montenegro are small, fragmented and threatened by over-collecting for the pet trade and possibly climatic changes.
A68;Salamandra_corsica;"It is found in a wide variety of habitats particularly mixed and deciduous woodland (Beech, Sweet Chestnut and Pine). This species gives birth to well developed larvae that complete metamorphosis in streams, ponds and other waters; fully metamorphosed young are occasionally produced.";;The main threats to this species are loss of woodland habitat (especially as a result of forest fires). However, it is not believed to be significantly at risk.
A70;Salamandra_lanzai;It is associated with rocky alpine meadows and scree slopes, often close to small streams, usually above the tree line. The known sites of this species at lower elevations may have mixed or coniferous forest. It gives birth to one to six fully metamorphosed young on land (Noellert and Noellert 1992), and is not associated with water. This species hides beneath rocks and stones when inactive and may be found in pastureland and other slightly modified habitats.;;While there are no major threats to this species, some localized development for tourism might be disturbing the habitat, and many individuals are killed by cars.
A71;Salamandra_salamandra;It is associated with wet cool deciduous, mixed, or rarely, coniferous forests with well shaded brooks and small rivers. Within the mountain forest belt, the species can be found in woodlands, glades and forest edges, rocky slopes, dense bush, and herbaceous vegetation. It is possible, that the occurrence of S. salamandra on woodless mountain pastures and within hayfields indicates the past existence of forests. In the Iberian Peninsula the species may be found in upland Mediterranean type forest and associated habitats. The species prefers microhabitats covered with dense leaf-litter and moss. In general, the female gives birth to well-developed larvae, that complete metamorphosis in streams, ponds and still waters. However, the subspecies, S.s. bernardezi and S.s. fastusa may give birth to two to eight fully metamorphosed young on land. The species does tolerate some habitat modification, and has even been found in gardens.;;The principal threats include localized general habitat destruction, unsympathetic forest management, and pollution of breeding sites by agrochemicals, collection for commercial purposes (i.e., the pet trade), introduction of predatory species (salmonids and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii )) and population fragmentation. The mortality of adults on roads is a localized threat in some parts of its range. The presence of chytridiomycosis has been reported in some Spanish populations.
A73;Salamandrina_perspicillata;It is mainly found in forests with dense undergrowth in hilly and mountainous areas, often in north-facing mountain valleys. Only females of this species are aquatic during the short oviposition phase for which well-oxygenated waters, slow running streams (usually with rocky beds), drinking troughs, and residual and vernal ponds (sometime of very small dimensions) are used. This species shows high site fidelity to breeding sites.;It appears to avoid seriously modified habitats. ;In parts of the species range there are some localized declines through habitat loss and aquatic pollution. But overall, it is not significantly threatened.
A74;Salamandrina_terdigitata;It is mainly found in forests with dense undergrowth in hilly and mountainous areas. Only females of this species are aquatic during the short oviposition phase, for which well-oxygenated waters, slow-running streams (usually with rocky beds), drinking troughs and ponds are used. Little information is available on the ecology and reproductive biology of this species.;It appears to avoid seriously modified habitats;In parts of the species range there are some localized declines through habitat loss and aquatic pollution. But overall, it is not significantly threatened.
A85;Triturus_carnifex;"There are a wide variety of terrestrial habitats from beech woodlands to arid Mediterranean climates. Its breeding and larval development take place in various stagnant permanent and temporary aquatic habitats. This species can be found in modified habitats such as quarries and artificial water bodies such as stony wells, tanks and drinking troughs. In central and southern Italy, artificial water bodies can be the commonest breeding sites (e.g. Romano et al . 2007; Corsetti and Romano 2007)";;It is sensitive to changes in water quality. The principal threats to the species are loss of aquatic habitats, especially breeding sites, through agricultural intensification and agrochemical pollution, and introduction of predatory fishes. In the Balkans, there has been loss of breeding habitats in recent years due to decreased spring rains, perhaps as a result of global climate change, and presumed mortality of individuals because of predation by introduced fishes.
A86;Triturus_cristatus;It can be found in coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests (composed of pine, birch, oak, alder etc.), their glades and edges, in forest steppe, bush lands, pastures, meadows, parks and gardens. Reproduction in permanent stagnant and in semi-flowing waters such as ponds flooded quarries, irrigation channels and ditches. The usage of small ponds is typical across the range. It can be found in modified habitat types, but this species is not considered to be very adaptable.;, rarely lakes,;The species is sensitive to changes in water quality. Correspondingly, industrial pollution of water, destruction and drainage of ponds seem to be the most harmful factors for T. cristatus . The impact of natural factors such as ponds overgrowing, shallowing and eutrophication is harmful to urban populations and those near to the range margins. Introduced predatory fishes are leading to declines in some areas. In some parts of the range (of the former Soviet Union) there is substantial commercial collecting of this species for the pet trade. Habitat fragmentation is a threat.
A87;Triturus_dobrogicus;It is found in open habitats with mixed deciduous forests and groves, bushlands, flooded meadows and swamps, and also in agricultural landscapes and villages, and riparian groves in the steppe regions. It might in some instances be strictly aquatic. This species may coexist with fish in oxbow lakes, river margins and other non-temporary waterbodies, and may also occur in disturbed habitats including those close to human settlement (Griffiths 1996). Reproduction takes place in small ponds with stagnant water, or in channels, ditches and flooded areas. It intergrades with other species of the former Triturus cristatus complex along the contact zones.;;The main threats to this species are rapid anthropogenic habitat destruction (for example, through drainage and damming), and pollution of its wetland habitats (especially floodplains). Hybridization with other crested newt species at the edge of its range is also a threat. In the southern part of its range, there has been loss of breeding habitats in recent years due to decreased spring rains, perhaps as a result of global climate change.
A90;Triturus_karelinii;"It can be found in mountain forests (broad-leaved and coniferous species) and their surroundings; the forest steppe and even true steppe sites within the mountains. The majority of such populations are the relics of a former forest fauna. Within these landscapes, these populations inhabit slopes and plateau covered with meadows or xerophytic vegetation. Such habitats are especially widespread in the parts of the species' range in Crimea and southern Azerbaijan. In general, T. karelinii seems to be more resistant to xeric habitat conditions than other Triturus newts. Breeding takes place in slow moving stream pools, ponds and occasionally drainage ditches. The female deposits approximately 100-250 eggs; these are individually wrapped in aquatic vegetation. The species can withstand some degree of habitat modification.";;Deforestation and pollution of wetlands by agrochemicals appear to be the main threats to this species. In the former Soviet Union there is significant commercial collecting of this species for the pet trade. In Turkey there are no immediate threats to this species, as it is widespread and found in many habitat types. Within Iran it is threatened by urban sprawl along the Caspian coast and foothills, agricultural development (rice cultivation) and logging. In the Balkans, there has been loss of breeding habitats in recent years due to decreased spring rains, perhaps as a result of global climate change. In Greece the loss of aquatic habitats is a serious threat to this species.
A91;Triturus_marmoratus;Aquatic habitats include well-vegetated ponds, pools, ditches and streams generally within dry woodlands, heath land, fields and rough grassland. Breeding and larval development take place in many different types of permanent and temporary water sources, usually with aquatic vegetation for reproduction. It can occur in slightly modified habitats such as traditional farmland.;;Major threats are agricultural intensification, drainage, pollution, and eutrophication of aquatic habitats through intensive agricultural. Mass mortality of the species through disease (iridovirus) has been recorded in Carris Lake, Peneda-Gerês National Park, Portugal. The disease might be non-native and have been transferred to the lake by an introduced predatory fish ( Lepomis gibbosus ). Predation by L. gibbosus and other introduced predatory fish and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) species is also a threat to T. marmoratus in parts of its range. There is some illegal collection of the species for the pet trade.
A93;Triturus_pygmaeus;This species inhabits broadleaf ( Quercus oak) woodland in meso-Mediterranean and thermo-Mediterranean climates. Aquatic habitats used for breeding and larval development include temporary or permanent ponds, lagoons, abandoned quarries and wells, drinking troughs, irrigation ponds, ditches and other areas of stagnant or slow-moving water. It is found in traditional farmland areas and other slightly modified habitats.;;The most significant threat to this species overall is habitat loss, especially the loss of temporary ponds. In the west of Spain and southern Portugal populations are affected by predation by non-native crayfish and predatory fish. Increasing urbanization surrounding Madrid has also led to the elimination of many populations. In southern and eastern Spain, over-exploitation of groundwater resources, agrochemical pollution, loss of traditional breeding sites and the introduction of predatory non-native fish and crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ) has led to a serious population decline. In Portugal this species is also affected by the drainage of temporary ponds, associated with the intensification of agriculture.
R17;Blanus_cinereus;It is a subterranean species found in a wide variety of Mediterranean habitats. It is often found in moist, sandy soils that are easy to burrow in and have a high level of humus. It occurs in low intensity agricultural land. The females lay a single egg.;;"The threats to this species are not well known; it might be locally threatened by urbanization. It is known to be eaten by wild boar Sus scrofa, which are expanding their distribution in Spain and Portugal, but the extent to which this constitutes a threat is unclear."
R18;Blanus_strauchi;It is a fossorial species found in a variety of sparsely vegetated Mediterranean habitats. It is often found in moist, sandy soils that are easy to excavate and have a high level of humus. It can presumably occur in low intensity agricultural land.

Populations are often present in rocky mountainous and coastal regions. It can be found on rocks, trees, buildings and other habitats that it can climb on. The females lay from three to 12 eggs per clutch (Disi, 2002). In north Sinai it can be found in cultivated areas such as orchards (S. Baha El Din pers. comm.).;;There generally appear to be no major threats to this widespread species. In Egypt it is threatened by overcollection for the pet trade and habitat loss in some areas through coastal development (S. Baha El Din pers. comm.).
R159;Phrynocephalus_guttatus;This species is generally associated with areas of sandy soil, sometimes with a sparse vegetation cover. The subspecies P. g. salsatus is closely associated with alkali soils, but occasionally it can be found on the slopes of barkhans (sand ridges). It is territorial species, females are more settled but have a smaller home range than the male. Reproduction begins at the end of April, with the eggs laid from May to June, and the young appearing in the middle of July.;;This species is threatened in lowland parts of its range through the conversion of habitat to intensive agriculture and plantation use.
R160;Phrynocephalus_helioscopus;It is present in clay and stony desert and semi-desert areas, generally with a spare cover of vegetation. Animals can be found in dry stream beds and sandy areas mixed with pebbles (Anderson 1999).;;In parts of its range, this species is threatened by overgrazing and habitat transformation to agriculture.
R161;Phrynocephalus_mystaceus;This species is generally associated with open sand dunes. Animals have also been recorded from flat desert areas, where populations are limited to sandy flats with a low shrub cover, on sandy, gravel strewn hammada and on barren salt flats (Anderson, 1999). Animals are often observed in suitable habitat close to roads (Anderson, 1999). The female lays between two and six eggs.;;It is locally threatened by the stabilisation of dunes and the conversion of dune habitats to agricultural land (through irrigation), mining (sand extraction) and urban areas.
R13;Anguis_cephallonica;It occurs in humid areas within meadows, scrubland, open forests (both deciduous and coniferous), hedgerows and wooded stream sides. It also occurs in rural gardens and traditionally farmed agricultural areas.;; It appears to be a reasonably adaptable species, but is generally killed when it is encountered. Human-caused fires (such as those in the Peloponnese in 2007) may be a threat.
R14;Anguis_fragilis;"Populations of this species can be found in grassy meadows, woodland glades, heathland, at the forest edge, in forest clearings, with alluvial forest, under hedgerows, in parkland and rural gardens. Animals have been found burrowing in loose sand and under rocks.  It is an ovoviviparous species; the female gives birth to between three and 26 young.";;It is threatened in parts of its range by a general loss of habitat due to agricultural intensification and urbanization, fires and reafforestation of clearings. Animals are also killed on roads in parts of its range, and predation by cats is a threat in some areas. Unmediated mitigation projects, such as the translocation of subpopulations, are a threat to some UK populations. It is not collected commercially.
R186;Pseudopus_apodus;This species is found in dry, well vegetated rocky slopes, marquis, traditionally cultivated areas and close to human settlements. In Iran, it has been collected in open grassy areas (Anderson, 1999).

R88;Eryx_jaculus;This species can be found inhabiting open dry steppes and semi-deserts. It appears to prefer clay and stony soils. In the Caucasus it is found at altitudes from 1,500 up to 1,700m asl along the river valleys. On the northern border of its distribution range (in southern Russia) it has been recorded from the sheep's fescue-sagebrush steppe. Habitats everywhere are associated with arid landscapes. It can be found burrowing through the soil and often lives in rodent burrows. It is ovoviviparous, the females produce between six and 20 live young in August - September. Pregnancy continues about 5 months. Period of activity lasts from March - April to the beginning of October.;, and is more rarely it is encountered on stabilized sands and in vineyards and gardens.;This species appears to be declining in various parts of its range, especially in the west. It is susceptible to intensification of agricultural methods, pollution, overcollection of animals and persecution by people. In Egypt it has been heavily overcollected for the pet trade and suitable habitats have been destroyed, mostly through quarrying and reclamation of land for agriculture.
R89;Eryx_miliaris;"This species is widely distributed in sandy deserts, in shifting sand dunes and semi-stabilized sand dunes. It prefers relatively loose soils on different types in deserts and semi-deserts (sagebrush Artemisia-glasswort Salsola desert and glasswort desert). Sometimes, animals can be found in clay and loess deserts, on the takyr with patches of vegetation near the sands, on the slopes of the ravines and on the margins of irrigated lands, as well as in the dry foothills on the valleys with sandy-clayish soil. It may also be encountered in vineyards. Animals often hide within the sand and use burrows of rodents and ruins as refuges. It is nocturnal during the hot part of the year; and is common on the surface in spring. The period of activity lasts for March to October over most of its range; and in the area of eastern Ciscaucasia and Kazakhstan from April to September. The species is viviparous, with the female giving birth for 4 to 15 young in July - August.";;This species is threatened by habitat loss resulting from intensive agricultural expansion, the abandonment traditional agricultural areas, overgrazing of vegetation by livestock, mining and drilling operations (oil, salt, mirabilite, sulphur, natural gas), and industrialization in parts of Middle-Asia (including factories, and chemical plants). The subspecies E.m. nogaiorum is declining rapidly due to habitat loss and conversion of sandy dune habitats through irrigation to intensive agricultural use.
R220;Chamaeleo_africanus;This species has been recorded from salt marshes, sand dunes and maquis shrubland. Animals are found climbing in vegetation such as reeds and shrubs. It has sometimes been found climbing in large trees. It is sometimes found on the ground in sandy areas. It has been recorded from traditionally cultivated agricultural land and rural gardens. In Greece, the females produce a single clutch of between four and 43 eggs per year.;;In Greece, the main threat to the species is loss of sand dune breeding habitat to developing tourism, and illegal collection (as pets). Mortality on roads is also an importantly threat to the Greek populations, especially during the breeding season. In Egypt, the main threat to this species is overcollection for the pet trade. It is also probably threatened by the reclamation of wetlands in the northern Nile delta (S. Baha El Din pers. comm.).
R27;Chamaeleo_chamaeleon;It is a diurnal species found climbing in bushes in dry habitats. It inhabits shrubland, plantations, open pine woodland, orchards (such as almonds and olive groves) and gardens. In Egypt, it also occurs on vegetation in sparsely vegetated open gravel plains. The females produce a single clutch of between five and forty-five eggs per year, these are buried in the soil.;;It is threatened locally by loss of habitat through urbanization and the development of tourist facilities, agricultural intensification, predation by domestic animals, accidental mortality on roads and by illegal collection of animals. It may be used for remedies or as a talisman in North Africa (not in Egypt). Animals are caught, sometimes illegally, for the international pet market and are offered to tourists at local markets. In Turkey, forest fires are also a threat.
R28;Coronella_austriaca;It is found in moorland, rocky coastlines, open woodland (deciduous, coniferous and mixed) and scrubland, hedgerows, woodland edges, heathland, sandy coastal sites, rocky areas, screes, subalpine and open areas with sparse vegetation. On the southern Iberian Peninsula and Greece it is largely restricted to upland or montane areas. Between two and 19 fully formed young (3.9 on average) are born at the end of August - October. The period of activity lasts from end of March - April to September - October but this varies largely according to latitude and altitude.;;It is threatened in parts of its range by the intensification of agricultural practices, afforestation of open areas (e.g.. in Belgium) and fires in woodland or scrubland. Many populations are vulnerable because of their fragmented nature, and through  overgrowth of the species preferred open habitats (for instance, in abandoned traditional farmland). Populations from the southern Iberian Peninsula (Sierra Nevada) could be threatened by climate change and displacement by more competitive Mediterranean species (Juan M Pleguezuelos pers. comm., October 2008). Intrinsic threats for southern populations include poor recruitment capacity, extremely low density, isolation of populations, and global climate warming (for mountain populations) (Juan M Pleguezuelos pers. comm., October 2008). While it is not collected, the species is sometimes persecuted through confusion with vipers.
R29;Coronella_girondica;This species is found in a variety of scrubland, open woodlands, dry hedgerows, grassland, rocky areas, orchards and plantations. The females lay between one and sixteen eggs (mean of 4.8 eggs). This species is a specialist predator of small lizards.;;"In Spain it is locally threatened by habitat loss through fire and perhaps disturbance by wild boars (Sus scrofa). It is also threatened by habitat loss through ongoing agricultural intensification and by accidental mortality of animals on roads. It is considered to be threatened in France and is approaching extinction in Monaco; however in Italy it is not considered to be particularly threatened."
R219;Dolichophis_caspius;"It is found in dry areas of open scrubland (macchia) and woodland, steppe and other grassland, rocky hillsides, semi-desert, overgrown areas, vineyards, olive groves, rural gardens, stone walls and ruins. In the North Caucasus it has been recorded from sand dune habitats. This species hibernates in large groups (R. Ajtic pers. comm.). In the Crimea, it emerges from hibernation at the end of March - beginning of April; in Kalmykia it emerges in the second part of March. Winter hibernation starts in middle of September - October (sometimes in first part of November). It is active during the day in spring, and in the hot part of summer it has two peaks of activity. Females lay eggs (6 - 18 eggs in the clutch) from middle of June to the beginning of July, with young appearing in the first part of September.";;While there appear to be no major threats to the species, it is often killed by traffic while it is basking on roads.

It is persecuted by humans in many parts of its range.
R226;Elaphe_sauromates;"This diurnal species is often encountered in rocky slopes in Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation. These open areas have been created over many years by non-intensive agriculture and livestock practices. It is normally found in the arid landscapes, in steppes and semi-deserts, as well as in the forest-steppe zone (both on the plain and in the foothills), on the areas of stony and sandy semi-desert, on the slopes with bush vegetation and with rocky outcrops, on forest edges, in open steppe and tugai forests. To the north of the Kara-Bogaz-Gol depression in northwestern Turkmenistan this snake lives on thick loamy soils with thickets of saxaul, saltwort and other xerophytic vegetation. In the central Ustyurt of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, animals can be found in areas of solid stabilized sands, at locations with saxaul vegetation in the clay desert, and on solonchaks (saline soils). It is an egg-laying species; the females lay a clutch of between 4 and 16 eggs.";;There are no major threats to this species as a whole. It is generally persecuted throughout its range but not at a level that is of a threat to the species. It is declining significantly in Romania, largely through habitat loss (CoE, 2003). The cultivation of steppe and similar habitats is leading to an overall decline in numbers.
R103;Hemorrhois_hippocrepis;This slender bodies colubrid snake is adapted to vertical substrates, and occurs in a wide variety of arid, dry and rocky habitats. It is very adaptable to modified habitats, commonly found in scrubland, coastal plains, arable land, pastures, vineyards, almond and olive groves, rural gardens, villages and cities in and around buildings.

It has also been recorded from areas of brackish water. The species lays between three and 20 eggs.;;It is threatened in parts of its range by aquatic pollution, especially through the loss of prey species (e.g.. fishes). It is threatened in Switzerland, and presumably other parts of the species range, by channelization of rivers and other waterbodies. As with many snake species, individual animals are occasionally killed by people, as they are often confused with venomous vipers. In Tunisia, desiccated specimens are sold as souvenirs to tourists (Juan M Pleguezuelos pers. comm., October 2008).
R155;Natrix_natrix;It is found in humid as well as dry areas with abundant vegetation.

The females lay one to five eggs, with several clutches produced in a season.;;There appear to be no major threats to this species. Habitat loss and the introduction of competitors or predators are potential threats to the subspecies Podarcis hispanica atrata, the populations of which are confined to islands.
R172;Podarcis_lilfordi;This species occurs in arid rocky areas and in scrubland. The females may lay three clutches annually consisting of one to three eggs.;;It is believed that the introduction of cats and other predators resulted in the extirpation of the species from the main islands of Mallorca and Menorca. Extant populations are threatened by the translocation of invasive predators between islands by visitors, and the illegal capture of animals for the pet trade. This species may also be threatened through eating poisoned bait left for seagulls and rats, and the loss of vegetation on some islands due to overgrazing by goats. Some populations are inherently at risk because of their small sizes and restricted ranges.
R173;Podarcis_melisellensis;It is found in dry open woodland, scrub, pastures and overgrown areas. It can be found on cliffs, rocks and stone walls. The females lays two to eight eggs per clutch.;;There appear to be no major threats to this species overall. Some distinct island populations may be threatened by the introduction of cats and other predators (such as the Indian mongoose on some Adriatic islands [Roberto Sindaco pers. comm., October, 2008]).
R174;Podarcis_milensis;It can be found in open areas of traditionally cultivated land, open scrubland, sand dune systems and damp marshy coastal areas.

It can be occur in rocky and scree areas, scrubland, deciduous and coniferous woodland, orchards, vineyards, fields, stone walls, and on buildings. It is often found in human settlements including large cities and villages and railway lines which may be a possible method of dispersal. The females lay two to three clutches of two to six eggs per year. This species has been introduced in many places in Germany and the United Kingdom, often presumably by hobbyists (e.g. terrarium owners).;;There generally appear to be no major threats to this adaptable and widespread species. Populations are locally threatened in parts of its range, including those on islands or in mountains (for example through the development of alpine tourism in the Central Mountains of Spain). Several populations, principally in Northern Europe, are threatened by the loss of suitable habitat to agricultural intensification and overuse of pesticides. This species is frequently encountered in the pet trade, however the overall impact of this is not considered to constitute a major threat. The introduction of non-native subspecies may represent a threat to some localized populations.

R178;Podarcis_raffoneae;The species lives in suitable habitats present on the volcanic islands: rocks, macchia, shrublands. It is an egg-laying species.;;The main threats are the introduction of alien species (mostly the competitor P. siculus), stochastic events due to the extremely small areas inhabited by the species and its small population size (less than 1,000 individuals overall). Collecting may also be a threat.
R179;Podarcis_sicula;It is found in grassy areas, roadside verges, hedgerows, scrubland, woodland edges, inside pine plantations, vineyards, orchards, meadows, coastal dunes, parkland, urban areas, and on stone walls and buildings. In the northern part of its range, it mainly lives in riparian or coastal areas. It thrives in habitats disturbed by human activities in the southern part of its range. It is an egg-laying species (Sindaco and Romano, pers. comm. 2008).;;There are no major threats to this adaptable species.  In the northern part of its range, it is threatened by small scale agricultural conversion of its riverine habitats.  Localized or insular populations may be vulnerable by predation by cats, but generally it is an invasive that can displace native populations of other species in its invasive range (the southern part of its range and in the areas where it has been introduced).  Because it is locally common, this species is collected for use as food for pet snakes.
R180;Podarcis_tauricus;It is a largely terrestrial species found in open areas of steppe, grassland, meadows, field edges, olive groves, traditionally cultivated land, rural gardens, sparsely vegetated sandy dunes and sometimes in open scrub.

The females lay clutches of six to 12 eggs.;;The species is not threatened as a whole, but insular populations are potentially threatened by introduction of predators or overcollection. Podarcis siculus (probably introduced in Sardinia in historical times) perhaps out competes this species when the habitat is opened for agricultural land and pastoral land. It is probably also affected by fire and land-use change.
R182;Podarcis_vaucheri;It is generally found climbing over rocks, in overgrown areas, on stone walls, on rock outcrops in alpine meadows, in bushy vegetation and in rural buildings. The females lay one to five eggs, with several clutches produced in a season.;;Local populations might be affected by habitat loss for agriculture, but overall this species is not significantly threatened.
R183;Podarcis_waglerianus;This is a largely terrestrial species found in areas of scrubland, woodland edges, pasture, cultivated land and rural gardens. The females lay clutches of four to six eggs.;;The populations on Sicily appear to be stable, although on small islands it could be threatened by competition and hybridization with P. sicula. A number of insular populations (e.g., that of Marettimo Island) might be threatened or declining, possibly due to invasive predators.
R185;Psammodromus_hispanicus;It is found in areas of open, loose soil, especially those with a sparse Mediterranean-type scrub. It can be found in coastal dunes and grassland.

It is often considered to be a pest species, and is controlled in vineyards as it eats grapes.
R123;Timon_lepidus;This species is found in open and dry areas of woodland, scrubland, olive groves, vineyards, meadows, arable areas and sandy or rocky sites. It is generally present in areas that have refuges such as bushes, stone walls, rabbit burrows and other holes. The females lay clutches of five to twenty two eggs.;;It is generally declining because of ongoing habitat loss, pesticide pollution and poisoning. Predators might also be eating this species more, due to the decline of rabbits. Also reduced livestock grazing might be reducing open areas suitable for this species. Current attempts to revive the former tradition of eating this species would also be very detrimental.
R137;Zootoca_vivipara;This species has been recorded from a wide variety of habitats including grassland, meadows, humid scrubland, hedgerows, open woodland, woodland edges, peat bogs, stream edges, coastal areas (sea cliffs and sand dunes) and rural gardens. In most areas the female gives birth to between three and 11 fully formed young. In northern Spain, adjacent France, Austria, Italy and Slovenia, the female lays between one and 13 eggs in a single clutch. In the northern portion of the range and at high altitude it is viviparous, in the southern portion it is oviparous.;;This species is locally threatened in parts of its range by habitat loss resulting from agricultural intensification, urbanization and development of tourism facilities (for example in alpine regions). It is suspected that populations have declined in the UK (John Wilkinson, pers. comm.). Some populations of this species that could be specifically distinct might prove to be threatened. This species is categorized as Least Concern in Switzerland (Monney and Meyer, 2005).
R2;Ablepharus_budaki;This species is found in the leaf litter of woodland, forested and shrubby humid areas. It can be found in rural gardens. It is an egg-laying species.;;This species is threatened by forest fires in Turkey. There appear to be no threats to this species in Cyprus. It is possible that deforestation is a threat to this species in Lebanon.
R4;Ablepharus_kitaibelii;This species is found in dry areas including south facing slopes, meadows, scrubland and clearings in woodland (both deciduous and pine). It is generally found close to ground cover such as leaf-litter, dead wood, stones, bushes and other vegetation. The female lays a clutch of two to four eggs.;;"This species is threatened by forest fires in Turkey.  Overall, there appear to be no major threats to this species. In parts of its European range the species is threatened by afforestation, deforestation and conversion of suitable habitat to agricultural, forestry or industrial use (Gasc 1997; CoE, 2003)."
R19;Chalcides_bedriagai;This diurnal species is associated with open, sandy areas with sparse vegetation. The species can also be found in scrubland and areas of open woodland, and can burrow into loose soil. It can live in lightly modified areas. The females give birth to one to four fully formed young.;;Modification of habitat, especially in coastal regions, has led to localized declines in this species. Some of the insular populations are considered to be threatened. Some populations are threatened through intensive afforestation of their habitat with pine trees (Juan M Pleguezuelos pers. comm., October 2008). It is also probably affected by the impact of increasing Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) populations.
R21;Chalcides_chalcides;This species is found in sunny areas with dense vegetation. Habitats include, grassland, meadows, areas close to streams, hedges, open cork-oak forest and the edges of cultivated areas. It can also be found in arid and degraded areas. The females give birth to three to thirteen fully formed young.;;The species is not considered to be threatened over much of its range, but habitat loss through intensification of agriculture may be the main threat to the species in some areas. It is considered to be threatened in the freshwater/coastal zones of its range, especially as a result of habitat loss due to urbanization and tourism development.
R22;Chalcides_ocellatus;It is a highly adaptable species that is often associated with arid to moist sandy, open areas or places with sparse scrub. It is found in coastal dunes and stabilized vegetated dunes further inland and It is also found in orchards, vineyards, fields, oases, rural gardens and urban areas. A terrestrial species found close to ground cover such as stones and vegetation. It is largely nocturnal in the summer and diurnal in the winter. The females give birth to between two and twenty fully formed live young.;;There are no major threats to this species.

It is heavily collected for the pet trade and scientific research in parts of its range (e.g.. Egypt).
R23;Chalcides_sexlineatus;It is found in a wide variety of habitats including, humid meadows and valleys, arid gullies and sandy areas, woodland, cultivated land, especially stony areas or sites with stone walls. The females give birth to between two and seven fully formed young.; and plantations (the species is rarer in these habitats);There is some collection of this species for the pet trade, but not at a level to constitute a threat to the species. There is also predation of the species by cats, but this is also unlikely to be a significant threat.
R24;Chalcides_simonyi;It lives in fields, orchards, gardens and in rocky areas. It is usually found in areas with well-formed soil. The females give birth to fully-formed young.;;The main threat is fragmentation of populations due to climatic changes (increasing aridity), loss of soil due to erosion. The main population was probably lost in a volcanic eruption in the 18th century. Feral and domestic cats are also a threat.
R25;Chalcides_striatus;This species is found in sunny meadows, grassland, pastureland, open shrubland, hedges and open abandoned cultivated land. It western parts of its range it is also present in drier scrubby and coastal areas. The females give birth to one to twelve fully formed young.;;It is threatened by intensification of agriculture, afforestation with pine trees and the abandonment of traditional meadows (resulting in scrub encroachment). Global warming is considered to be a threat for the southernmost populations (Juan M Pleguezuelos pers. comm., October 2008).This species is persecuted in parts of its range as it is mistakenly believed to be poisonous. Populations of this species are often fragmented by unsuitable habitat.
R26;Chalcides_viridanus;It is found in most coastal, arid and moist habitats It can be found in urban areas on Tenerife. The females give birth to one to six fully formed young.;, being only largely absent from densely wooded areas.;It is locally threatened by predation by cats.
R91;Eumeces_schneideri;This species occurs in a wide range of arid habitat types, including Mediterranean shrubland, semi-desert and rocky areas. Animals are not foundin forested habitats. It can be found in open vegetation close to oases, in bushes and steppe grassland, sandy hills, dry cultivated land and semi-desert. The female lays a clutch of between three and 20 eggs.;;Numerous subspecies are declining across much of its range from habitat loss due to agricultural conversion. There are minimal threats to the species as a whole, and mostly from habitat loss and urbanization, but overall its status is secure. In Egypt it is threatened by heavy overcollection for the pet trade, and by overgrazing, quarrying, collection of firewood, land reclamation for agriculture and off-road vehicle use.
R157;Ophiomorus_punctatissimus;This species burrows in soil and can be found hiding under stones. It occurs in open areas of grassland, scrubland, and low vegetation with loose soil. It can be found in olive groves.;;The threats to this species are not well known. It is unlikely that there are major threats given its habitat preferences, but more research is needed.
R141;Trachylepis_aurata;This species is found in rocky and well vegetated areas that are often close to water. It can be found in cultivated land, among ruins and in rural gardens. It is an ovoviviparous species, the female gives birth to between three and eight young.;;There do not appear to be any threats to this widespread species.
R142;Trachylepis_vittata;This species is found in a wide variety of habitats. It occurs in open areas of sandy or stony soil with sparse grass or bushy vegetation. Animals may also be found at the edge of fields, on the banks of irrigation canals, or in rural gardens. In Egypt is found near to wetlands and in coastal areas. In Tunisia the species is largely restricted to areas of oasis. It is an ovoviviparous species, the females give birth to between three and six young.;;There appear to be no major threats to this widespread species. Populations may be locally impacted by conversion of land to agriculture or habitat loss to tourism development. There is some commercial collection of this species in Egypt.
R203;Xerotyphlops_vermicularis;This largely subterranean species is associated with moist, sparsely vegetated, open areas. It is often found in grassy fields and slopes. It is found under rocks and occupying burrows made by worms. Animals are generally only found during the springtime. The females lay between four and eight eggs in a clutch. This species shows an aggregation behaviour for either mating or moisture conservation (Disi, 2002). It is found in traditional agricultural areas, among ruins and even in urban areas. Pairing occurs from the spring to the beginning of summer. The female lays 2 to 10 eggs in underground passages in second part of summer.;;There are no major threats to this species over most of the Mediterranean region. In Albania and Egypt it is threatened by habitat loss through intensive agriculture and land reclamation. Populations of this species in the Caucasus are threatened by the conversion of habitat to intensive agricultural use.
R145;Macrovipera_lebetina;This species is known from semi-arid stony slopes, rocky ravines, dry foothills and mountain valleys. It is found in the very diverse desert and montane-steppe biotopes. Populations can be found in grassland and cultivated areas, in shrubland, in open pistachio woodlands, on the banks of irrigation channels and it is regularly recorded close to small water courses. It is an ovoviviparous species, females give birth to between 8 and 43 live young.;;"This large viper is generally persecuted throughout its range. The species is heavily persecuted in Cyprus, principally for sport, and may be threatened on the island although new legislation and active public awareness campaigns aim to protect the species. If they are found to exist, the populations in North Africa are relictual with very restricted ranges and may be significantly threatened by persecution. There is some illegal exportation of this species for the pet trade from Turkey. Locally the populations have been seriously affected by intensive collecting for venom. Lowland populations in Central Asia are declining because of habitat conversion from agriculture and associated irrigation schemes; populations in montane regions where there is little development are more stable."
R146;Macrovipera_schweizeri;It can be found throughout the islands on dry, sunny hillsides and in traditionally cultivated land, in densely vegetated areas close to water with rocky outcrops, and also in pools of water. Its most important habitat is small creeks. The female lays a clutch of between four and 11 eggs.;;It is threatened by illegal collection of animals, direct persecution when encountered, accidental mortality on roads and ongoing habitat loss through mining and quarrying concessions. Illegal collection, mortality and mining are still ongoing, but at a lower level than before as a result of regulation and conservation measures. Fires (caused by humans) and tourist development are also important threats. In the species' stronghold in western Milos there are tourist developments causing habitat loss and increased shortage of water.
R153;Montivipera_xanthina;This species is found in Mediterranean scrubland and mountain steppe habitats. It can be found in rural gardens, cultivated land, olive groves and among ruins. The females give birth to between two and 15 young.;;A number populations in western Anatolia, Turkey, appear to be threatened by overcollection for the pet trade. There is some illegal export of this species from Turkey. There is some localized persecution of this species.
R206;Vipera_ammodytes;"This species is associated with rocky areas but can be opportunistic in other habitats. It can be found in dry, often rocky habitats, including open woodland and scrub, sand dunes, hillsides, screes, stone walls, traditionally cultivated land, gardens and vineyards. The species is ovoviviparous; females give birth to between four and 15 young.";;It is  locally threatened by overcollection in parts of its range (e.g., in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania and isolated populations in the Alps) by collection of animals for venom extraction. As with many snakes, this species is generally persecuted by people.
R207;Vipera_aspis;This species is found in dry, rocky areas, open scrubland, open woodlands, closed forest, hedges, pastures and stone walls. It often occurs on the edge of natural habitats, and is characteristic of chestnut woods in Italy. The species is common in mesic habitats. The females give birth to between five and 22 young.;It is rare in suburban areas and arable land. ;This species is threatened by loss of habitat through agricultural intensification, and to a lesser degree loss of habitat resulting from the development of tourist facilities and urbanization. The species is often found in open areas and overgrowth of these sites is an additional threat (for example in the Jura Mountains) (Jaggi and Baur, 1999). The species is persecuted by people, and illegally collected for the pet trade. Some populations are threatened through mortality on roads.
R208;Vipera_berus;It is present in a wide variety of habitats including, open woodland and shrubland, hedgerows, field edges, heathland, moors, grasslands, alpine meadows, dunes and marshes. It generally requires humid habitats. The female produces between three and 18 young.;;In Europe, populations of this species have been significantly fragmented by the intensification of agricultural methods and development. Populations of this species are susceptible to persecution and collection for the pet trade (Ursenbacher, 1997). It is threatened in Romania by illegal collection of animals for venom extraction (CoE, 2003). In some parts of its range afforestation, and succession as a result of abandonment of traditional agricultural practices, are threats.
R213;Vipera_latastei;This species is found in generally moist, rocky areas, in dry scrubland and woodland, hedgerows, stone walls and sometimes in coastal dunes. The females give birth to between two and 13 young. On average, females give birth only once every three years.;;This species has declined throughout much of the lowlands and even in the montane areas of Iberia. Threats identified include direct persecution when encountered, coastal urbanization, afforestation with coniferous trees, burning of suitable habitat, intensification of agricultural practices, and accidental mortality (particularly of males) on roads.
R227;Vipera_renardi;It is primarily associated with open meadows and hillsides. Upland subspecies are generally found on well-drained rocky hillsides, steppe and meadows, while the lowland forms are found in either steppe, or dry or damp meadows. It occurs in plain and sagebrush steppes, alpine meadows transformed into steppe, solonchaks (saline land) semi-deserts and stabilized sands. This species is absent in cultivated lands and remains only ravines, roadsides and river banks. Thus, for instance, in the lower left bank area of the Dnieper river in the Zaporozhskaya, Dnepropetrovskaya and Khersonskaya regions the viper is found only in the narrow strip of a steep bank with bush vegetation in the area between water and arable land. It is an ovoviviparous species. Pregnancy lasts up to 3 months. Young appear (up to 17) in July - August. It is active in Azerbaijan from the beginning of April up to beginning of October.;;The major threat to this species is the conversion of traditionally farmed meadows to intensively cultivated and grazed land because it prefers open meadows and other suitable land suitable for agriculture.  Development for agriculture has also led to significant fragmentation throughout its range. There is a small international pet trade of this species which is not a significant threat. Montane populations may be significantly impacted in the future by climate change.
R217;Vipera_seoanei;This species is found in areas of low scrubland, woodland edges and open areas. It known also to occur in pastoral and agricultural land. The females give birth to three to 10 young every two years.;;This species is threatened by direct persecution when encountered, loss of habitat through fire, and the intensification of agricultural methods, in particular the destruction of hedges in pastureland.
R218;Vipera_ursinii;"It is primarily associated with open meadows and hillsides. Upland subspecies are generally found on well drained rocky hillsides, steppe and meadows, while the lowland forms are found in either steppe, or dry or damp meadows. The lowland subspecies are sometimes found in marshy areas. It gives birth to live young; the female has between two and 22 young.";;The conversion of traditionally farmed meadows to intensively cultivated and grazed land has caused significant declines in populations of this species in Central and southern Europe, most especially among lowland subspecies. Also, afforestation of alpine grasslands (because of abandonment of traditional agricultural practices) is a threat to the species in some areas.  Construction of ski-runs and roads are significant threats to montane populations. Montane populations of this species may also be affected by increasing climate change, in particular the impact of temperature change on populations of important prey species (e.g.. Orthoptera) and breeding biology. In the Balkans, it relies on prey species (Orthoptera) which is highly sensitive to pollution, hence it may be used as a habitat quality indicator.  In France, some well known localities in Italy, and other parts of the range it is collected for the pet trade, and like many species of snake it is persecuted.
B100;Accipiter_brevipes;This species breeds mainly in fragmented deciduous forests along river basins but may also use broad-leaved forests on foothills and mountain slopes, usually below 1,000 m but up to 2,000 m (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It arrives at its breeding grounds in April or early May and eggs are laid in May or early June. It nests in tree branches, preferring deciduous trees such as alder, poplar or aspen. The nest is a smallish platform of sticks (30 cm wide, 15 cm deep), lined with twigs and sometimes leaves. Occasionally it will use the old nests of other birds. Clutch size is three to five eggs (Orta and Marks 2014). It feeds mainly on lizards, fledgling birds and large insects such as dragonflies, grasshoppers and cicadas (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is a migrant, likely wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Marks 2014). Birds leave their breeding grounds in September, returning in April and May. On migration it frequently flies at night using flapping flight and travels in flocks which become especially large at certain bottlenecks (Orta and Marks 2014).;;It is highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). This species is considered undesirable for falconry in Georgia, and many are killed after being captured by falconers who are attempting to catch other, more desirable species (Orta and Marks 2014).
B102;Accipiter_gentilis;The species is mainly resident, but its northernmost populations in Scandinavia and Russia migrate south between September and November, returning in March and April (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Marks 2014). Soaring flight is used frequently (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is always seen singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It inhabits mature woodland, preferring areas near clearings and the forest edge. Small birds and mammals make up the vast majority of its diet, with grouse, pheasants and partridges being especially important in boreal zones. Nests are built on the forks or branches of large trees and are made of sticks, lined with twigs and fresh leaves. Clutches are usually two to four (Orta and Marks 2014).;;Significant declines in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries are thought to have resulted from persecution and deforestation, with later declines in the 1950s and 1960s a result of poisoning from pesticides and heavy metals. Persecution continues to be a threat, as is nest robbing for falconry (Orta and Marks 2014). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind farm developments (Strix 2012).
B101;Accipiter_nisus;The species is migratory in the north of its range, with these birds wintering in southern Europe, southern Asia and less commonly in Africa (Meyburg and Marks 2014). Further south, birds tend to be resident or dispersive (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Marks 2014). Migrants move south between July and November, returning between March and June (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds are generally solitary, except when nesting, and tend to migrate singly although large concentrations do form at narrow sea crossings (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It mainly inhabits forest, although preferring this to be interspersed with open areas. Small birds make up the vast majority of its diet. The nest is built in the lower crown of trees, on a fork or branch. A new nest is built each year by both sexes and is a platform of sticks with little or no greenery. It typically lays three to six eggs (Meyburg and Marks 2014).;;Widespread persecution, especially from gamekeepers, in the 20th century caused large numbers of the birds to be killed (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Marks 2014). Sharp declines in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s were driven by the use of harmful organochlorine pesticides, which causes direct mortality of adults as well as reduced breeding success. The species is still trapped in its thousands annually in Turkey, where it is used by falconers, but habitat alteration is thought to be the major contemporary threat (Meyburg and Marks 2014). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).
B94;Aegypius_monachus;"The species inhabits forested areas in hills and mountains at 300–1,500 m. Two different eco-geographical categories occur in Europe: lowland sierras covered by dense Mediterranean maquis (Spain and Greece) and sub alpine forests (Spain) (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, including forest, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands (Batbayar et al. 2006).

Egg-laying occurs February to April, often in loose colonies or nuclei. It builds a very large (145–190 cm wide, 95–300 cm deep) stick nest, mainly in evergreen oak (Quercus) or pine (Pinus) in Spain and in Armenia and Azerbaijan mainly in juniper (Juniperus).Clutch size is typically one egg (Meyburg and Christie 2014). Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken (Batbayar et al. 2006). The species is largely resident although some small scale dispersive movements occur in Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997)."; Nesting on rock is extremely rare in Europe. ;"The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination (Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs (Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar in litt. 2005). There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several Gyps vultures in India, may have a negative impact on this species (N. Batbayar in litt. 2005). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested (Lemus et al. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, and deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacterial flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections (Lemus et al. 2008). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal (Anon. 2004b); however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers (A. Brunner in litt. 2010). In eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady in litt. 2007). Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. Habitat loss is also thought to be important (Anon. 2004). Outside of Europe, the majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar et al. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species."
B109;Aquila_adalberti;This species occurs in alluvial plains and dunes in the Guadalquivir marshes, plains and hills in central Spain, and high mountain slopes in the Sistema Central and other areas of Portugal, where there is an absence of irrigated farmland (Fernández et al. 2009). It nests only on trees, typically in the crown (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). Data from Doñana National Park in Spain show that the most important variables explaining nest site selection are height of tree and distance from human activity (Bisson et al. 2002). Both adults construct the nest, a large structure of twigs with a cup lined with green twigs, fur, grass and debris. Each pair has between two to six nests, but reuse of same nest in consecutive seasons fairly common. Clutch size is between one to four eggs (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). The abundance and distribution of rabbits, its favoured prey, influences population density, range (Fernández et al. 2009) and reproductive performance. Indeed, its evolutionary dependence on rabbits has been suggested as permanently limiting its abundance and distribution (Ferrer and Negro 2004), although a recent study has suggested the species exhibits a certain dietary plasticity, at least during the non-breeding season, adapting its diet when rabbits are scarce (Sánchez et al. 2010). Many recently-colonised territories are in marginal areas, and several of the occupying pairs include at least one sub-adult bird (González and Oria 2004, González et al. 2006b, Margalida et al. 2007). Adults are sedentary but young birds, when they become independent disperse in all directions (strongly influenced by prevailing winds at time of departure), regularly travelling up to 350 km (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013).;;"The analysis of 267 records of non-natural mortality in this species over a 16-year period (1989-2004) shows an average annual rate of 15.1 individuals found dead annually, and that electrocution (47.7%) and poisoning (30.7%) were the most frequent causes of mortality (González et al. 2007). Juveniles are frequently killed through electrocution by powerlines, and this has increased in recent years (L. M. González in litt. 2005). This remains the primary threat in Andalucía, with six birds found to have died this way in 2011 and three found dead in 2012 where mitigation measures had been attempted (J. R. Garrido in litt. 2013). Renewable energy development poses another potentially significant threat. Habitat fragmentation has occurred as a result of deforestation for agriculture and timber, having negative impacts on nest site preferences in particular. Suitable habitat in breeding and dispersal areas has also declined as a consequence of urban development and land-use changes (e.g. new irrigation schemes in Huelva (B. Sánchez in litt. 2007)). Mortality from intentional poisoning has risen sharply, particularly in hunting reserves where game is commercially exploited. Between 1990 and 1999, 57 birds died from poisoning and this is thought to be the primary cause of declines in the late 1990s (J. Criado in litt. 1999). In Doñana National Park in particular, the population has been seriously affected by the illegal use of poisoned bait, especially during the 1990s (Ortega et al. 2009). Rabbit populations have declined in both Spain and Portugal, as a result of viral haemorrhagic disease, and this is believed to have reduced breeding success (Margalida et al. 2007; S. Cabezas-Díaz, J. C. Atienza et al. in litt. 2013). In addition, changes in the management of hunting estates in both Spain and Portugal to favour larger quarry species, such as deer and boar, rather than rabbits and partridges, has further reduced prey availability (B. Sánchez in litt. 2007, S. Cabezas-Díaz, J. C. Atienza et al. in litt. 2013). In spring 2009, a male bird was shot and killed in Portugal, highlighting the current threat of hunting to this species. Human activities in the vicinity of active nests can disturb incubating adults and reduce hatching success (González et al. 2006, Margalida et al. 2007). The ingestion of lead shot embedded in the flesh of prey items may be a problem in certain areas (González and Oria 2004, Pain et al. 2005). Recent modelling suggests no subpopulations are currently at risk of extinction, provided that active management is maintained (L. M. González in litt. 2005)."
B111;Aquila_chrysaetos;"This is the most widespread of the Aquila eagles, ranging across the Nearctic and Palearctic (70°N to 20°S). It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1,000 km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (>65°N), such as Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in south-east Europe and the Russian steppes. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson- Lees and Christie 2001). The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line (Watson 2010), from sea level to 4,000 m (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species’s diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5–4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson- Lees and Christie 2001). Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2 m in diameter. The breeding season spans March – August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson- Lees and Christie 2001).";;The species was heavily persecuted in the 19th Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped, and it is declining in Spain (Katzner et al. 2012a).  In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are records of mortality as a result of electrocution when perching on power lines, but no data to suggest any substantial demographic impact. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species (Watson 2010).  Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner et al. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices and climate change, may threaten the species in the future (Watson 2010).
B112;Aquila_fasciata;The species occupies garrigue, maquis, rocky habitats and pine and evergreen forests alternated with small dry fields of low intensity farming from sea level to 1,500 m (Tucker and Heath 1994, Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Juveniles often occupy areas near large water bodies (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In the Mediterranean region egg-laying occurs mainly from February to mid-March (Orta et al. 2013). The nest is up to 2 m in diameter, composed of sticks and located on remote cliff ledges or in a large tree. The nest is re-used in successive years (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and pairs will often have several nests. Clutch size is normally one or two eggs but very occasionally three (Orta et al. 2013). The eagle's prey principally comprises of small or medium-sized birds, but it will also take mammals, some reptiles, insects and rarely, carrion (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is resident throughout its range, although juveniles will disperse up to 200 km and individuals occasionally wander further afield and pass through key migration routes (Shirihai et al. 2000, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;Since the 1950s the species has declined throughout its range. It was affected by pesticide use in the mid-20th Century and since then populations have not recovered to their pre-organochlorine levels. The species is persecuted by hunters and pigeon-fanciers in the west of its range and juveniles suffer high mortality from collisions with power lines (Rollan et al. 2010). Declining prey availability, increasing human disturbance and poaching at nest sites, and agricultural intensification are thought to be key factors in the species's decline (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2013).
B110;Aquila_heliaca;This is a lowland species that has been pushed to higher altitudes by persecution and habitat loss in Europe. In central and eastern Europe, it breeds in forests up to 1,000 m and also in steppe and agricultural areas with large trees, and nowadays also on electricity pylons. In the Caucasus, it occurs in steppe, lowland and riverine forests and semi-deserts (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). Wetlands are apparently preferred on the wintering grounds. From late-February to early-May adults return to breeding areas. Both sexes construct a large stick nest, typically 100?150 cm in diameter with the nest cup lined with green sticks and other materials such as grass, fur and wool. Clutches are usually two to three eggs (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). It hunts small to medium-sized mammals as well as birds and carrion. In the Caucasus the main prey include hare, tortoises, lizards and carrion (Tucker and Heath 1994). Adults in central Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey and the Caucasus are usually residents, whilst most immatures move south. (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013).;In Turkey it is known to very rarely nest on the ground or on cliffs. ;Breeding sites are threatened primarily by intensive forestry in the mountains, and by the shortage of large indigenous trees in the lowlands. Other threats are loss and alteration of feeding habitats, shortages of small and medium-sized prey species (particularly ground-squirrels Spermophilus spp.), human disturbance of breeding sites, nest robbing and illegal trade, shooting, poisoning and electrocution by powerlines. Habitat alterations associated with agricultural expansion threaten historical and potential breeding sites in former range countries. Hunting, poisoning, prey depletion and other mortality factors are also likely to pose threats along migration routes and in wintering areas.
B108;Aquila_nipalensis;In Europe this species inhabits virgin plain or hill-steppes, semi-deserts and remote steppic valleys amongst mountains, preferably where feather grass (Stipa pennata) or wormwood (Artemisa) are present and especially where rodents such as suslik are common (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It returns to its breeding grounds between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and breeding occurs April to July. Birds time their arrival for spring and the start of breeding is highly dependent on availability of its chief prey species. The nest is constructed of sticks with the nest cup lined with smaller twigs and many other materials, such as old rags, bones, moulted feathers and camel dung. Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees. It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas (Meyburg and Boesman 2013). When susliks are scarce they will feed on middle-sized mammals or dead saiga antelope (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (Meyburg and Boesman 2013).;;The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). It is also adversely affected by power lines and is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). Young eagles are taken out of the nest in order to sell them to western European countries (Mebs & Schmidt 2006). This species is also vulnerable to the veterinary drug diclofenac (Sharma et al. 2014).
B103;Buteo_buteo;"Populations in Scandinavia and most of the former Soviet Union are migratory, wintering in Africa and southern Asia. Those elsewhere are resident (Orta et al. 2015). Migrants move south between August and November and make the return journey between February and May. Birds tend to occur singly or in pairs, sometimes forming small family groups at roosts. However, they can migrate in groups they form huge concentrations at peninsulas and narrow straits (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is strictly diurnal, and also often follows mountain ranges and ridges (Brown et al. 1982). It inhabits a wide variety of habitats but requires at least some tree cover for nesting and roosting; ideal habitat appears to be forest edge, or mosaics of forest and open areas. It is versatile depending on the prey animals available, with small mammals usually predominating, but in some areas invertebrates making up the majority. The nest is built on a fork or branch of a large tree, usually near to forest edge. It is a bulky platform of sticks and twigs, lined with greenery near trunk 3–25 m above ground, or on cliff ledge. Clutches are normally two to four eggs (Orta et al. 2015).";, and as birds avoid sea crossings (and even freshwater bodies) as far as possible, ;In the U.K., it suffered a significant reduction in available prey in the 1950s when a myxomatosis epidemic killed off c.99% of the rabbit population. The most important historical threat though has been from persecution, including through poisoned bait traps, with pesticides and habitat loss also causing some declines (Orta et al. 2015). It is highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).
B105;Buteo_lagopus;"This species is typically found in tundra, mainly treeless, although also wooded tundra and even extreme northern taiga, particularly in years of lemming and vole abundance. In the winter, it is often in areas more modified by humans, such as pastures, hayfields and croplands, but still mainly in open terrain such as prairies, marshes and shrublands. Egg-laying normally occurs from May to June. Nests are built on vantage points; normally high on cliffs, rocky outcrops or riverbanks, preferring protected ledges but infrequently uses trees and slopes.  The nest is a bulky nest of sticks or twigs, lined with grass, sedges, hair and feathers. Clutches are usually three to five eggs. It feeds principally on mammals, mainly voles and lemmings. It will also take small birds, fish, insects and carrion. The species is migratory (Orta et al. 2015).";;"In Sweden many birds were recovered in the area where they were rung due to hunting; illegal shooting may be a problem in some areas. It also suffers mortality from collisions with cars and electrocution from powerlines (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). The species may also suffer reduced reproductive success from fluctuating weather caused by climate change (Pokrovsky et al. 2012)."
B104;Buteo_rufinus;This species inhabits uncultivated and dry scrubby areas near to suitable nest sites on crags, gorges and mountains up to 1,600 m. Nests are built mainly on cliffs but it does sometimes use trees in rural regions (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and electricity pylons (Tucker and Heath 1994). Both adults build a nest of twigs and sticks lined with green leaves, wool or other materials. Nests can be re-used and it will also use the old nests of other birds. Clutch size is normally two to four eggs (Orta 1994). It feeds preferentially on small mammals such as susliks (Citellus) but its diet is diverse, including lizards, snakes, small birds and large insects (Tucker and Heath 1994). In Europe, it is uncertain if it is completely or partially migratory in the north of its range but it is sedentary in the south. Those that do migrate move south to North Africa and southern Asia, leaving their breeding grounds in August and September and returning in March and April (Orta 1994). It is generally observed singly, in pairs or in small family groups, but is more gregarious on migration when larger flocks can form (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;It is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). The species is also threatened by habitat destruction though agricultural intensification which may also reduce prey species. Electrocution has also caused fatalities (Mebs and Schmidt 2006).
B95;Circaetus_gallicus;Birds breeding in the Palearctic are migratory. Most migrants winter in tropical North Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Kirwan 2013), with small numbers staying in southern Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Migrants move south between August and November, and north between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are usually observed singly or in pairs, even on migration, though migrants will sometimes form groups of up to 12 (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They soar at c.20–100 m above the ground (Brown et al. 1982). It uses a variety of habitats within warm temperate and tropical environments, and is recorded up to 1,200 m. It specialises in feeding on reptiles, particularly snakes. The nest is almost always built in low trees, usually on the crown and is constructed of sticks and twigs, and lined with green leaves or grass, occasionally even pine needles. Usually only a single egg is laid (Orta and Kirwan 2013).;;Changes in agriculture and land use have reduced the extent of suitable hunting habitat. In addition snake populations have been reduced by increased cultivation of monocultures, hedge destruction, use of pesticides and the abandonment of traditional farmland and subsequent afforestation. Habitat fragmentation has resulted from forest fires and road construction. The species is often shot and nests destroyed and it suffers mortality from powerlines (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B96;Circus_aeruginosus;It is mainly migratory, although populations in western Europe are generally resident (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds in September and October, wintering from France south as far as sub-Saharan Africa (Orta et al. 2014). They begin their return journey in February and March, arriving in March and April (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). Migration is generally on a broad front, although there is some concentration at a few sites (Brown et al. 1982). Hundreds of birds occasionally gather at roosting sites, sometimes with other harriers such as C. pygargus, but otherwise they are usually solitary, associating only temporarily at especially rich feeding sites (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). They have a slightly greater tendency to be gregarious while on migration but the above still generally applies. Birds fly c.10–30 m above the ground (Brown et al. 1982). The species inhabits extensive areas of dense marsh vegetation, in fresh or brackish water, generally in lowlands (Orta et al. 2014), up to 400 m (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is a generalist predator taking a variety of prey types, with small birds generally preferred but mammals such as voles, rabbits and rats being more important in parts of its range. The nest is a pile of reeds built in dense marsh vegetation. Typically lays three to six eggs (Orta et al. 2014).;;"Major threats include wetland desiccation and drainage; persecution by shooting; pollution, especially from excessive pesticide use in and around wetlands, and poisoning by heavy metals, notably the consumption of lead-shot through feeding on contaminated waterbirds (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). The historical threat of hunting in southern Europe has mostly subsided, but illegal shooting is still rife locally, notably on Malta (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is also highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012)."
B97;Circus_cyaneus;"This species inhabits open country with some grass or shrub cover, especially grassland, steppe, meadows, moorland, scrub and cultivation and it is also found in wetlands and young conifer plantations. In the winter it becomes more widespread, for example occurring over ploughed land. Egg-laying begins in mid-April and continues until early July but varies with latitude; in Europe it peaks in May. It nests on the ground, in dense grass or scrub, crops or marshy vegetation. The nest is a pile of small sticks and grass, 30–60 cm wide. Clutch size is usually three to six eggs. It feeds mostly on vertebrates, especially mammals such as voles, mice and ground squirrels. It also takes birds of open habitats like wetlands and grasslands, particularly passerines. Birds are often the principal prey in the breeding season. The species is completely migratory in northern and north-east Europe and is partially migratory and dispersive elsewhere (Orta et al. 2014).";;"The current main threat is the transformation of habitat owing to intensified agriculture, disappearance of marshes and reafforestation. Persecution is still severe locally, for example on managed grouse moors of Scotland; in 2013 not a single pair successfully nested in England (Pitches 2013), despite the fact that there is estimated habitat for more than 300 pairs (Fielding et al. 2011). The species is also shot illegally in central and eastern Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994)."
B98;Circus_macrourus;This species breeds in uncultivated grasslands. It  selects wetter areas for nesting, preferably with sparse shrubs and weeds (Tucker and Heath 1994). It will nest above 1,000 m in the Caucasus (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species returns to its breeding grounds in March and April and nests in loose colonies. The nest consists of a pile of grass placed on the ground and protected by vegetation. Clutch size can be from three to six eggs but usually four or five (Orta and Christie 2015). Birds fly at c. 1.9 m above the ground when hunting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Christie 2015). The principal prey is small rodents (mostly voles and mice), lizards, and small birds, especially fledglings but it is also quite capable of taking larks and other passerines, in flight as well as on the ground (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory, with most birds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa or south-east Asia. They leave their breeding grounds between August and November and return in March and April (Orta and Christie 2015). Birds migrate on a broad front, with only minor concentrations at bottleneck sites (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Christie 2015). Although birds are most often seen singly, females and juveniles can form parties of 10–15 on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;evidently avoids very dry open sites and;In its breeding range it is primarily threatened by the destruction and degradation of steppe grasslands through conversion to arable agriculture, burning of vegetation, intensive grazing of wet pastures and the clearance of shrubs and tall weeds (Galushin et al. 2003, E. Bragin in litt. 2007). Fires are started by farmers, arsonists and dry thunderstorms (E. Bragin in litt. 2007).
B99;Circus_pygargus;"This is a migratory species, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). It leaves its breeding grounds in August and September, beginning their return in March and April (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta et al. 2014). Birds tend to migrate on broad fronts, but there are concentrations in Gibraltar and along the Rift Valley (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). Nevertheless it will readily migrate over expanses of water (Brown et al. 1982). Birds tend to hunt alone, although they do gather at high prey concentrations and will roost in groups of often over 50, sometimes communally with C. macrourus and C. aeruginosus (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is a bird of open country, usually in lowlands. Small birds and mammals form the majority of its diet; voles are a particularly dominant food source locally in abundant areas. It nests in tall vegetation on the ground. The nest is a small, narrow platform, 20–40 cm wide, made of grass stems or thin twigs. Clutches are normally three to five eggs (Orta et al. 2014).";;In the past, the use of organochlorine pesticides seemed to cause a decline in Europe (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is currently in decline owing to the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure in the species (Orta et al. 2014). Intensification on this land increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is commensal with some forms of agriculture, and changes in these practices could leave it potentially vulnerable by depleting its supply of small birds and mammals to prey on (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2014). It is highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).
B107;Aquila_clanga;"This species occurs in lowland wet forests near wetlands, away from human settlements (Tucker and Heath 1994). It nests 5–25 m above ground in tall, usually broad leaf, trees inside the forest, a few 100 m from the edge. Both sexes construct a large platform of sticks with a central cup lined with fresh green sprigs or grass. The nest is often used in successive years and may therefore become very large, although many pairs have two or three nests used alternately. Clutch size normally two but second chick rarely survives due to cainism (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). It feeds on unretrieved quarry, small mammals, waterbirds, frogs and snakes. It hunts over swamps, wet meadows and, in Europe, over extensively managed agricultural land (A. Lõhmus in litt. 1999); birds soar to c.100 m high when hunting.

It is a migratory species, with birds leaving their breeding grounds in October and November to winter in southern Europe, southern Asia and north-east Africa (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013). They generally return in February and March. Birds migrate on a broad front, tending to pass in singles, twos and threes with the occasional larger group (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They do not concentrate at bottleneck sites to the extent of many other raptors such as Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina) (Meyburg and Kirwan 2013).";;"There is strong evidence of hybridisation between this species and C. pomarina (Bergmanis et al. 1997, Lohmus & Vali 2001, Dombrovski 2002, Vali et al. 2010). In some European countries mixed pairs can constitute 50% of pairs of this species (Maciorowski and Mizera 2010) or even more (Vali 2011). It is unclear whether this represents a new phenomenon or a conservation concern, but C. pomarina is far more numerous than C. clanga in the zone of overlap, and the range of C. pomarina appears to be spreading east, further into the range of C. clanga. Other key threats are habitat destruction and disturbance, also poaching and electrocution can be considered important. Suitable habitat mosaics have been lost as a result of afforestation and wetland drainage. 

In eastern Europe, agricultural intensification and the abandonment of traditional floodplain management have reduced habitat quality (A. Lõhmus in litt. 1999). Birds are intolerant of permanent human presence in their territories. Forestry operations are a major cause of disturbance. Shooting is a threat in Russia and the Mediterranean (P. D. Round in litt. 1998, P. Mirski in litt. 2012), together with deliberate and accidental poisoning across much of its range."
B106;Aquila_pomarina;"This is a migratory species, migrants leaving their breeding grounds between August and November, and returning in March and April (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg et al. 2014). It relies heavily on soaring flight using thermals. Birds are generally observed singly or in pairs, but will congregate at plentiful food sources, and migrate in flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Aspinall 2010). It breeds near forest edges, preferring moist woodland; most nest in lowlands but it is recorded breeding up to 2,200 m in montane areas. Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians are all taken as prey, with different prey types predominating in different parts of its range. Egg-laying occurs in late April and early May. Nests are built in trees, usually close to the forest edge and are a large stick construction, lined with green twigs and sometimes grass. Eyries are often reused over several years. Normally two eggs are laid (Meyburg et al. 2014).";, and thus avoids large bodies of water (Meyburg et al. 2014);The main threats posed to this species are through habitat loss (notably the draining of wet forests and meadows, and on-going deforestation) and hunting (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg et al. 2014). The latter is especially prevalent on migration, with possibly thousands of birds shot annually in southern Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).
B87;Elanus_caeruleus;"Northern populations of this species make long-distance migratory movements, travelling southwards to their wintering grounds between August and November and returning to their breeding areas between March and April (Hayman et al. 1986). In more temperate regions the species is sedentary or only locally dispersive (Pierce and Boesman 2013). The species breeds solitarily or in loose colonies of 2–50 or occasionally up to several hundred pairs (Urban et al. 1986, Pierce and Boesman 2013). It is typically a gregarious species, occurring in small groups (Snow and Perrins 1998) (up to 15 individuals) (Urban et al. 1986, Pierce and Boesman 2013) or larger flocks of several hundred up to a thousand individuals on migration, during the winter (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) and at nightly roosts (Urban et al. 1986).

The species typically breeds in shallow freshwater and brackish wetlands with sand, mud or clay substrates and open margins, islets or spits near water level (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable habitats include marshes and swamps, shallow lake edges, riverbeds, flooded fields, sewage ponds (Pierce and Boesman 2013), irrigated areas and fish-ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also breed around alkaline and high-altitude (montane) lakes (Pierce and Boesman 2013) or in more saline environments such as river deltas, estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow coastal pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (Pierce and Boesman 2013) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species occupies the shores of large inland waterbodies and estuarine or coastal habitats (Pierce and Boesman 2013) such as river deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow freshwater or brackish pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (Pierce and Boesman 2013) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet is strongly seasonal but generally includes adult and larval aquatic insects (e.g., Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, Diptera, Neuroptera and Lepidoptera), molluscs, crustaceans, spiders, oligochaete and polychaete worms, tadpoles (Pierce and Boesman 2013) and amphibian spawn (Urban et al. 1986), small fish, fish eggs (Pierce and Boesman 2013) and occasionally seeds (Urban et al. 1986). The nest is a depression or shallow scrape positioned on hard ground near water on a hummock (Flint et al. 1984) or amongst grass and sedge (Pierce and Boesman 2013). Alternatively the nest may be a more elaborate platform of vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) constructed on a floating mass of aquatic vegetation. The species nests singly or in loose colonies (Pierce and Boesman 2013), showing a preference for open areas close to foraging sites with good all-round (360 degree) visibility (Johnsgard 1981).";;Locally, populations are heavily impacted by annual rainfall. In eastern Europe (e.g. in Greece, Hungary and Bulgaria) declines are attributed to the loss of wetland habitats (Pierce and Boesman 2013). Disturbance by people and fluctuating water levels are also a threat to the species (Tinarelli 1992). In some areas, housing and commercial development threaten the wetland habitats of this species (Goutner and Papakostas 1992).
B91;Gypaetus_barbatus;This species occupies remote, mountainous areas, with precipitous terrain, usually above 1,000 m and in particular, areas where large predators such as wolves and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are present, and there are herds of mammals such as Mountain Goats, Ibex, and sheep (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is typically monogamous but polyandrous trios occur in the Pyrenees, probably in response to habitat saturation (Orta et al. 2014). Nesting occurs in December or January and the young hatch in February and March (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species will construct large nests (averaging 1 m diameter), composed of branches and lined with animal remains such as skin and wool, as well as dung and occasionally also rubbish. Nests are located on remote overhung cliff ledges or in caves and will be re-used over the years (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Clutches are one or two eggs. Both parents take part in nest building, nest defence, incubation, brooding and feeding of chicks (Orta et al. 2014). The species will forage over vast distances, using a soaring flight. Its principle food is carrion, with its diet including a large proportion of bones (as much as 85%) whereupon the bird gets nutrition from the marrow inside. The rest of its diet comprises tortoises, and occasionally also live mammals and birds. It is generally unwilling to compete with vultures at carcasses, and will wait patiently to feed, scavenging older carcasses if fresh meat is scarce. Bones are either consumed whole, broken using the bill, hammered against the ground, or lifted into the air and dropped from 50-80 m high onto hard rock. Tortoises are generally treated in the same way as bones. It is resident where it occurs, but has vast home ranges, and juveniles will wander even more widely than adults (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;The main causes of ongoing declines appear to be non-target poisoning, direct persecution, habitat degradation, disturbance of breeding birds, inadequate food availability, changes in livestock-rearing practices and collisions with powerlines and wind turbines (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Barov and Derhé 2011, S. Xirouchaki in litt. 2012). Despite the provision of targeted conservation actions, the European population remains susceptible to poisoning, and mortality caused by powerlines (J. A. Gil Gallus in litt. 2011). Since European reintroductions began, mortality from shooting has decreased, however poisoning (both intentional and accidental) has increased (Margalida et al. 2008).Veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens as mortality sources among scavengers that feed on medicated and diseased livestock carcasses have recently emerged as a threat. Three of five failed eggs of this species and four dead nestlings sampled in the Spanish Pyrenees from 2005-2008 had high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs (especially fluoroquinolones) and evidence of several livestock pathogens (Blanco and Lemus 2010). Rapid increases in grazing pressure and human populations in the mountains of Turkey are causing habitat degradation there (S. Viter in litt. 2014). Suitable habitat is also threatened by pipeline construction through the Caucasus mountains (S. Viter in litt. 2014).
B93;Gyps_fulvus;"Some birds are migratory, overwintering in Africa, although many others are resident or nomadic (Orta et al. 2015). It relies heavily on soaring flight, and has been shown to fly at altitudes of 10,000 m and higher. Birds hunt alone but congregate at food sources and roosts; they also tend to migrate singly, but concentrations (usually up to 15 individuals) form at sea crossings and strong thermals (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). It is a species of expansive open areas in a wide array of environments, from mountains to semi-desert, and is recorded regularly from sea level up to c. 2,750 m. It feeds almost exclusively on carrion, mainly that of large mammals. The nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred and it is a thin, fairly small platform of branches, sometimes stolen from other large raptors. A single egg is laid (Orta et al. 2015).";;"It declined markedly throughout the 19th–20th centuries in much of Europe, mainly due to direct persecution and ""bycatch"" from the poisoned carcasses set for livestock predators (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). In some areas a reduction in available food supplies, arising from changes in livestock management practices, also had an impact (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012)."
B90;Haliaeetus_albicilla;The species requires large and open expanses of lake, coast or river valley, within the boreal, temperate and tundra zones, near to undisturbed cliffs or open stands of large, old-growth trees for nesting. Its food is vertebrates (fish, mammals and especially birds), from marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. It is mainly migratory in the north and east of its breeding range, wintering in continental Europe and southern Asia, but sedentary elsewhere. Birds are usually seen singly, or in twos or threes (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;Threats that affect this species include loss and degradation of wetlands, human disturbance and persecution, environmental pollution, collision with wind generators (Krone and Scharnweber 2003), and indiscriminate use of poisons (Orta et al. 2013) and pesticides (Tucker and Heath 1994). Modern forestry methods reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Orta et al. 2013).
B113;Hieraaetus_pennatus;"The species is mainly migratory, although populations in the Balearic Islands are resident. Migratory birds winter in southern Africa; northern birds leave their breeding grounds in September and return in March and April (Orta and Boesman 2013). Migrants are thought to partially cross water on a broad front (assumed from regular occurrence on islands across the Mediterranean), but nevertheless many pass through bottleneck short crossing points each season. Birds tend to be seen singly or in pairs, and even on migration rarely form groups of more than five, and stay away from other raptors (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds soar c.200–300 m above the ground when hunting (Brown et al. 1982). It is a species of open woodland, preferring patches of forest interspersed with open areas; it is recorded up to 2,000 m. Small birds are the most important part of its diet. Nests are built in trees and are made of sticks and twigs, lined with fresh leaves. They are often reused each year. Normally two eggs are laid (Orta and Boesman 2013).";;Threats affecting the species include habitat degradation, direct persecution and human disturbance, each causing some decline in parts of Europe (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Boesman 2013). Declines in the Ukraine are being driven by deforestation (Orta and Boesman 2013). Habitat loss is also due to urbanization, construction of reservoirs and fire. The accumulation of organochloride pesticides in wintering areas may affect the species’s reproductive success (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012).
B89;Milvus_migrans;"This species is found almost ubiquitously throughout habitats. It inhabits semi-deserts, cultivated areas and fragmented woodland, preferring areas below 1,000 m with adjacent aquatic environments. It arrives at its breeding grounds between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and can be loosely colonial or a solitary breeder. Eggs are laid between March and June. It normally nests in the fork or on the branch of a tree but will also use cliff ledges and man-made structures.

The nest is constructed from sticks and lined with materials such as rags, plastic, paper, dung or skin and it, or at least the nest site, will be re-used annually. Clutch size is normally two or three eggs. An extremely versatile feeder, it takes carrion as well as live birds, mammals, fish, lizards, amphibians and invertebrates. Also human refuse has become a plentiful food source in many areas. The species is mainly migratory, with birds from Europe wintering in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East (Orta and Marks 2014). It is generally a gregarious species, with birds often roosting communally and migrating in scattered flocks (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Marks 2014).";In Europe, unlike elsewhere in its range, it generally avoids breeding in urban areas (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997);The species has suffered historically as a result of poisoning, shooting and the pollution of water by pesticides and other chemicals (Orta and Marks 2014). Carcass poisoning and water pollution continues to drive declines in Europe. Whilst it is well-suited to the presence of humans, particularly in terms of its diet, the modernisation of cities has been shown to reduce available habitat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B88;Milvus_milvus;The species breeds in broadleaf woodlands and forests, mixed with farmland, pasture and heathland. In winter it also occupies farmland without trees, wasteland, scrub and wetlands. Formerly an urban scavenger, it still visits the edges of towns and cities. Eggs are laid between March and May. The nest is a platform of sticks, often with rags or plastic incorporated, and normally lined with wool. It is built in a fork or on a wide side branch of a tree (coniferous or broadleaf), in forests, woods or clump of trees. Each pair normally has several nests, using the same one each year or alternating. Clutches range between one to four eggs, normally two but sometimes three. It takes a wide range of food, but feeds mainly on carrion and small to medium-sized mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are less important prey. Most birds in north-east Europe are migratory, wintering mainly in southern France and Iberia, but with some travelling as far as Africa (Orta and Christie 2013). Migrants travel south from their breeding grounds between August and November, returning between February and April (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes form small flocks, possibly family groups, when soaring on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;"The most pertinent threat to this species is illegal direct poisoning to kill predators of livestock and game animals (targeting foxes, wolves, corvids etc.) and indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from consumption of poisoned rodents by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, where it is driving rapid population declines (A. Aebischer in litt. 2009); there is a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter 2007). The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted (J. Vinuela in litt. 2009). Illegal poisoning is also a serious threat to the species in north Scotland, with 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 having been killed by poisoning (Smart et al. 2010). In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops (P. Tourret in litt. 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott et al. 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious future threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen et al. 2009, P. Tourret in litt. 2009) and more research needs to be conducted to assess the level of threat windfarms pose to the species. Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009),  hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret in litt. 2009), road-kills, deforestation, egg-collection (on a local scale) and possibly competition with the generally more successful Black Kite (Milvus migrans) (Cardiel in litt. 2000, Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001, Cardiel and Viñuela 2007, Mammen 2007). Another factor implicated in the declines in France and Spain is a decrease in the number of rubbish dumps (Cardiel and Viñuela 2007, Mionnet 2007)."
B92;Neophron_percnopterus;This species forages principally in arid open areas such as steppes, savannas and river banks (Tucker and Heath 1994). Nesting occurs in cliffs or crags, occasionally in trees and it sometimes occupies the old nest of another raptor. Birds usually form monogamous pairs but occasionally polyandrous trios too. Both sexes construct a nest of sticks with a deep central cup, which is usually heavily lined with a range of materials including wool, hair, rags and the remains of food, even excrement, although sometimes scarcely lined at all. Clutches vary from one to three eggs, although normally two (Orta et al. 2013). It has a broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and faeces. It is usually solitary, but will congregate at feeding sites, such as rubbish tips, or vulture restaurants (i.e. supplementary feeding stations). It also scavenges at human settlements, and forms roosts of non-breeding birds (Ceballos & Donázar 1990). This species is migratory and most European birds will winter in sub-Saharan Africa between 14° and 17°N although a few winter in Spain (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;"This species faces a number of threats across its range. Disturbance, lead poisoning (from gun shot), direct poisoning, electrocution (by powerlines), collisions with wind turbines, reduced food availability and habitat change are currently impacting upon European populations (Donázar et al. 2002, N. Petkov in litt. 2005, Kurtev et al. 2008, Zuberogoitia et al. 2008, Carrete et al. 2009, Dzhamirzoev and Bukreev 2009, Sara et al. 2009, Angelov et al. in prep. 2011). Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009) and the Balkans (I. Angelov in. litt. 2012). Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional muladares in Spain and Portugal (Donázar 2004, J. C. Atienza in litt. 2007, Lemus et al. 2008, Donázar et al. 2009, Cortás-Avizanda et al. 2010, Donázar et al. 2010a, Cortés-Avizanda 2011); however, recently-passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers (A. Brunner in litt. 2010). Poisoning is a threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete et al. 2007, Carrete et al. 2009, Cortés-Avizanda et al. 2009), and through the consumption of inappropriately disposed of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries such as Spain (Lemus et al. 2008) and Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted high levels of contamination of the species leading to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease (Lemus et al. 2008) (e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria (Kurtev et al. 2008)). It appears that Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2007 news (www.birdlife.org/news)), is driving the recent rapid declines in India (Cuthbert et al. 2006, A. Rahmani in litt. 2012). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects (BirdLife International 2007 news (www.birdlife.org/news)). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by Gyps spp. vultures (Cuthbert et al. 2006). Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donazar et al. 2002, Donazar et al. 2007a) and  potentially risky in other regions of Spain (Donazar et al. 2007b, 2010b). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) may reduce breeding success in the short-term (Kurtev et al. 2008)."
B86;Pernis_apivorus;This is a migratory species, wintering in in tropical Africa. It leaves its breeding grounds in August and September, returning between April and June (Orta et al. 2013). Birds are mostly solitary except on migration, when they flock throughout, gathering in large numbers at preferred crossing points as well as roosting socially (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Aspinall 2010, Orta et al. 2013). They fly chiefly by soaring, although are able to cross wide stretches of water with flapping flight (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is diurnal (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is found in forests and woods, preferably deciduous, but also mixed forests in temperate and boreal zones. It also uses a variety of habitats with both wooded and open areas, including heathland and cultivated area. It feeds mainly on wasps and hornets. Nests are built in woods, preferentially in deciduous trees. Typically lays two eggs (Orta et al. 2013).;;Many birds are shot on migration, notably in Italy, Malta and Lebanon (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2013). Population declines in northern Europe have resulted from deforestation, forest conversion and shooting. Human disturbance is also a threat. Pesticide use has not had significant impacts in Europe (due to the species living in woodland and feeding on wasps). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B85;Pandion_haliaetus;It inhabits the areas around shallow waters, being sufficiently tolerant of human settlement to persist in suburban and sometimes urban environments. It breeds from late May to early September and most pairs are monogamous but polygynous trios form where males can easily defend two nests. The nest is a large collection of sticks and flotsam, lined with grasses and moss where available, usually wedged high (up to 30 m above the ground) in an exposed tree or will also nest on cliff. Clutches are from one to four eggs. Its diet almost entirely consists of live fish (Poole et al. 2014). The species migrates on broad fronts and is not dependent on land bridges during migration (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migrants begin moving to lower latitudes in August and arrive by October, returning in March and April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;Human persecution was the main historical threat, prevalent from the 18th–20th centuries (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). A combination of deforestation and the collection of eggs and live birds drove the species extinct in Azerbaijan (Poole et al. 2014). Numbers fell from 1950–1970 as a result of pesticide use, although they are now recovering. Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor threat. In Scotland the species had been extirpated by collection and hunting but is now recovering (Poole et al. 2014, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), but shooting still affects many birds on migration in the Mediterranean, notably in Malta. It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B62;Anas_acuta;"The species shows a preference for open lowland grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998), prairie or tundra habitats (Johnsgard 1978) containing freshwater, brackish and saline wetlands with shallow water to facilitate dabbling (Kear 2005). Wetland habitats include shallow freshwater marshes, small marshy lakes, slow-flowing rivers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and wet meadows (Madge and Burn 1988), especially favouring ponds with low, dense marginal vegetation and wetlands interspersed with brushy thickets or copses (Johnsgard 1978). During the winter it also frequents large inland lakes (Scott and Rose 1996), brackish coastal lagoons, brackish (Madge and Burn 1988) and saline marshes (Steele et al. 1997), shallow fresh or brackish estuaries (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998), tidal flats (Madge and Burn 1988) and river deltas (Scott and Rose 1996) with adjacent agricultural land and scattered impoundments (Johnsgard 1978).

It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups from April to June (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a slight hollow on the ground amongst vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and can be close to or more than 1 km away from water (Kear 2005). This species is omnivorous (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and opportunistic (Johnsgard 1978), its diet consisting of algae (Brown et al. 1982), seeds (Hockey et al. 2005) and rice (Brown et al. 1982), tubers, and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants, sedges (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and grasses (Brown et al. 1982, Hockey et al. 2005), as well as aquatic invertebrates, amphibians and small fish. This species is strongly migratory throughout its northern range (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).";;The species is threatened by wetland habitat loss on its breeding and wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). Reclamation of coastal areas for industrial development poses a threat in Europe (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds in Russia (Grishanov 2006). It suffers from over-exploitation in Europe (Kear 2005). The species is predated by feral cats (Felis catus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) on islands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), and is susceptible to avian botulism (Rocke 2006) and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species is hunted recreationally in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and the Po delta, Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006). The eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B60;Anas_crecca;"The species shows a preference for shallow (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005), permanent waters (Johnsgard 1978) in the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), especially those in the vicinity of woodlands with fairly dense herbaceous cover available nearby for nesting (Johnsgard 1978). Small freshwater lakes and shallow marshes with abundant emergent vegetation  are preferred to open water (Johnsgard 1978), as are small waterbodies forming part of a larger wetland, lake or river system, especially in the valleys of small forested rivers. Other suitable habitats include small ponds, pools, oxbow lakes, lagoons and slow-flowing streams (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species frequents similar habitats to those in which it breeds (Brown et al. 1982), including marsh and lake habitats and other sheltered waters with high productivity and abundant vegetation (Kear 2005) as well as flooded fields and artificial waters (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species also occurs along the coast (Carboneras et al. 2013) on saline (Snow and Perrins 1998) or brackish lagoons with abundant submergent vegetation (Kear 2005), saltmarshes (Madge and Burn 1988), tidal creeks, intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1978), river deltas , estuarine waters and even sheltered coastal bays).

The species breeds from May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a hollow in the ground placed amongst dense vegetation (Carboneras et al. 2013) or under bushes close to water (rarely more than 100 m away) (Kear 2005). Clutch size is usually eight to eleven eggs. In spring and summer the diet of the species consists predominantly of animal matter such as molluscs, worms, insects and crustaceans. During winter the species mainly takes the seeds of aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2013). Northern breeding populations of this species are highly migratory (Madge and Burn 1988) although populations in more temperate regions are sedentary (Carboneras et al. 2013) or locally dispersive (Scott and Rose 1996).";;This species is threatened by lowland habitat loss and degradation (e.g. through wetland drainage) (Musil 2006) and by upland habitat loss due to afforestation and other land-use changes (Kear 2005). The species suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (France) (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). It is also intensively hunted in its winter quarters (Carboneras et al. 2013). The species is threatened by disturbance from human recreational activities (Pease et al. 2005), hunting (Bregnballe et al. 2004) and construction work (U.K.) (Burton et al. 2002). The species is susceptible to avian botulism (Rocke 2006) and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), France (Mondain-Monval et al. 2006) and Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006). The eggs of this species were (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B61;Anas_platyrhynchos;The species occurs in almost every wetland type. It requires water less than 1 m deep for foraging (Snow and Perrins 1998) and shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitats commonly frequented include flooded swampy woodlands, seasonal floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998), wet grassy swamps and meadows, oxbow lakes (Flint et al. 1984), open waters with mudflats, banks or spits, irrigation networks, reservoirs, ornamental waters (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), canals and sewage farms (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species may also be found in saline habitats along the coast (Madge and Burn 1988) where water is shallow, fairly sheltered and within sight of land (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds between March and June although the exact timing varies with latitude (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998) or bowl of vegetation that can be situated in many different locations such as within vegetation on the ground, in natural tree cavities (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), under fallen dead wood, on tree stumps and even in abandoned nests of other species (Flint et al. 1984). Clutch size is generally nine to thirteen eggs. The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, feeding on seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants, as well as terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates such as insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms and occasionally amphibians and fish (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In temperate regions breeding populations of this species are sedentary or dispersive, often making local movements during severe weather (Scott and Rose 1996). Other populations are fully migratory (Kear 2005).;, although it generally avoids fast-flowing, oligotrophic (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), deep, exposed, rough, rockbound waters and hard unvegetated areas such as rocky ground, sand dunes and artificial surfacing (Snow and Perrins 1998);The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss from pollution (e.g. petroleum (Grishanov 2006) and pesticide pollution (Kwon et al. 2004)), wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reedbeds (Grishanov 2006). The species also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (e.g. in Spain (Mateo et al. 1999) and France (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002)). It is also susceptible to duck virus enteritis (DVE) (Friend 2006), avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (Rocke 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases (although it may be able to withstand sporadic losses due to its high reproductive potential) (Rocke 2006). The species is predated by American Mink (Neovison vison) (Opermanis et al. 2001). The species is hunted throughout its range (Kear 2005) mainly for sport (Evans and Day 2002, Bregnballe et al. 2006, Mondain-Monval et al. 2006, Sorrenti et al. 2006). The eggs of this species were (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B49;Anser_albifrons;The species breeds in open (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), low-lying, shrubby tundra (Snow and Perrins 1998) on the coast and inland, in close proximity to marshes, lakes, pools, rivers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), and willow- and shrub-lined ponds and streams (Johnsgard 1978). It requires dry slopes, banks, mounds, hummocks or patches of sand or clay for nesting sites, especially those commanding good views of the surrounding area (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species winters in open country on steppe and agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and wet meadows (Johnsgard 1978)), or in brackish (Kear 2005) and freshwater marshy habitats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). It may also roost on tidal marshes, in sheltered bays or in estuaries and frequents inland lakes and reservoirs in North America (Kear 2005). The species breeds from late-May or early-June in single pairs or loose groups (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). The nest is a shallow construction of plant matter on the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992) amongst vegetation such as grass or dwarf scrub heath, often on raised hummocks or slopes to reduce the risk of flooding and provide a vantage point of the surrounding area (Kear 2005). Usually five to six eggs, although larger clutches are thought to be laid by more than one female. The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of the roots, leaves, stems, seeds and fruits of terrestrial plants such as herbs, grasses and sedges (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), as well as agricultural grain, wheat, rice and barley (Johnsgard 1978), potatoes and sprouting cereals (especially in the winter). This species is fully migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), travelling in stages via several stop-over sites between separate breeding and wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988).;;The species is threatened by intense hunting pressure (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) resulting in mortality and disturbance at staging (Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006). It is also susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Climatic changes are likely to cause range contractions in this species's already highly restricted breeding range (Kear 2005), and are already causing other species (e.g. Canada Geese (Branta Canadensis)) to move northward, increasing competition for resources (Kear 2005, Fox et al. 2006). Oil exploration in the tundra habitat poses a threat to the species's breeding (Kear 2005a) and moulting sites (Glahder and Walsh 2006) through oil spills and chronic oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), by direct habitat destruction (influencing breeding site selection and reducing reproductive success) (Kear 2005) and through human disturbance (Glahder and Walsh 2006). Wetland habitat degradation due to drainage, peat-extraction and changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) is also a problem in areas of Russia (Grishanov 2006).
B51;Anser_anser;"During the breeding season the species inhabits wetlands surrounded by fringing vegetation in open grassland (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), sedge or heather moorland (Johnsgard 1978), arctic tundra, steppe or semi-desert from sea-level up to 2,300 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). It nests near streams, saltmarshes (Kear 2005), river flood-plains, reedy marshes, grassy bogs, damp meadows, reed-lined freshwater lakes and estuaries (Johnsgard 1978) close to potential feeding sites such as meadows, grasslands, stubble fields and newly sown cereal fields (Kear 2005). It requires isolated islands out of reach of land predators for nesting. In the autumn (before migration) the species also frequents agricultural land (Kear 2005). In the winter the species inhabits lowland farmland in open country, swamps, lakes, coastal lagoons (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), reservoirs and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988).
The species breeds from May or April in loose colonies (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013, Kear 2005). The nest is a shallow construction of plant matter placed among reedbeds, on the ground (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), in or at the base of trees, under bushes or in sheltered hollows on isolated wooded islands on lakes or along coasts (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), as well as on rafts of vegetation in rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). Usually four to six eggs are laid (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of grasses, the roots, shoots, leaves, stems, seedheads and fruits of other herbaceous marsh vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978), and agricultural grain and potatoes. This species is fully migratory although some populations in temperate regions are only sedentary (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) or locally dispersive (Scott and Rose 1996), occasionally making irregular movements in very icy winters (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).";;This species is threatened by considerable hunting pressures across much of its range (Madge and Burn 1988, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and is susceptible to poisoning from lead shot ingestion (Mateo et al. 1998). It is also persecuted by farmers as it can cause considerable crop damage (Madge and Burn 1988, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). The destruction and degradation of wetland habitats due to drainage (Madge and Burn 1988, Grishanov 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), conversion to agriculture (Madge and Burn 1988, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), petroleum pollution, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds is also a threat, especially in breeding areas (Grishanov 2006). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B48;Anser_brachyrhynchus;"The species breeds on rocky outcrops, crags and steep river gorges in open arctic tundra (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), especially near seabird colonies. The species overwinters on extensive areas of saltmarsh (Kear 2005) in estuaries and on flat agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (e.g. improved or fertilised grasslands, stubble fields, pastures and newly sown cereal fields) (Kear 2005). In Scotland favoured winter daytime roosting sites include estuarine mudflats, lochs and reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988).
It breeds from mid-May to late-June or early-July (Kear 2005) in territorial pairs which may form loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a low mound of vegetation on cliffs, rocky outcrops or snow-free hummocks (Kear 2005). Three to five eggs are usually laid. The species is herbivorous (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and an opportunistic forager (Kear 2005). During the breeding season its diet includes leaves, stems, roots, berries and seed-heads of sedges, mosses, lichens, and grasses. In its wintering areas the species is more reliant on grass, grain, vegetables and potatoes grown on agricultural land. This species is fully migratory travelling on a narrow front between separate breeding and wintering grounds (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).";;The species is hunted illegally in the spring in Iceland which may become a threat. Disturbance from hunting on spring staging grounds in Norway has major negative impact on breeding success, and persecution (shooting and disturbance) of the species by farmers is likely to increase in the future if populations increase (due to the species's impact on agricultural grassland) (Kear 2005). The species is subject to hunting in Svalbard and Denmark as well as Norway, although mortality due to hunting does not seem to be a major factor controlling population sizes (O'Connell et al. 2006). Disturbance from farmers discouraging foraging individuals from their land in the winter has been shown to reduce the species's reproductive success in the spring (Madsen 1995), and the species is also threatened by general disturbance (e.g. from helicopters surveying areas for oil exploration) (Mosbech and Glahder 1991). It may be threatened by land-management changes (such as a reduction in the intensity of management and land abandonment) (Tombre et al. 2005), and by future habitat loss such as the development of hydroelectric projects on interior rivers in Iceland (which would flood a major moulting area) (Kear 2005). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus) predation (Madsen et al. 1992).
B50;Anser_erythropus;This species breeds in low-lying bogs, scrub-covered tundra and taiga-forest edges close to wetlands, up to 700 m Asl (Kear 2005). It can also be found on the slopes by the lower parts of mountain streams, on mountain foothills, mountain lakes and on alpine precipices, often in thawing boggy areas or on stone fields (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978). It often nests on snow-free patches available early in the breeding season (such as rocky outcrops or prominent hummocks) hidden amongst vegetation or in boggy hollows (Madsen 1996, Kear 2005), usually in close proximity to open water or marshy areas (Kear 2005). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with grass, moss and down and frequently the same site is used in subsequent seasons. Clutch size is normally four to six (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). This species is herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, stems, leaves, fruits and the green parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants. During the winter the species supplements its diet with winter agricultural grains. This species is fully migratory (Kear 2005). The species departs from its breeding grounds in northern Scandinavia and arctic Russia in late August to early September and travels to wintering grounds in south-east Europe and the Middle East (Alerstam 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998). Small wintering populations, originating from the reinforcement of the breeding population in Sweden, are now established in the Netherlands and Germany (Hornman et al. 2012, Kruckenberg and Krüger 2013). The return passage to the breeding grounds begins in February, with the species arriving from early May (Snow and Perrins 1998) to late June (Madsen 1996).;;"Illegal spring hunting and round-ups of moulting birds are taking place on the Russian breeding grounds (Jones 2011) and illegal shooting continues in Norway (T. Aarvak pers. comm. 2007). In the western Palearctic at least 20–30% of the population are shot each year (Mooij 2010) often accidentally during the hunting of other species. Habitat deterioration, as a result of land cultivation and increased water-levels in the Caspian Sea, is a further threat (Madsen 1996), as is habitat loss through the creation of reservoirs for hydroelectric power in Scandinavia (Madsen 1996). The species may also be threatened by nest predation from the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (Madsen 1996) and the restocked population in Sweden has suffered from predation by White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) (Jones et al. 2008). Disturbance on breeding grounds (e.g. from increasing tourism and angling) causes much disruption to nesting birds (Madsen 1996). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 28% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000).
 
Outside of the breeding season, high mortality in autumn and winter is caused by illegal hunting, and accidental shooting on the staging and wintering grounds is the most important threat (Madsen 1996, Aarvak et al.1997, Lorentsen et al. 1998, Kear 2005, Morozov 2006, Jones 2011). Disturbance of roosting and feeding birds by hunters is a potentially significant limiting factor on survival and breeding output (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995, N. Petkov in litt. 2007). In the Kaliningrad region of Russia, important migratory stop-over points on the Baltic Sea coastline are being degraded through petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for agriculture, changes in wetland management leading to scrub and reed overgrowth, peat extraction, and the burning and mowing of reed beds (Grishanov 2006)."
B47;Anser_fabalis;The species breeds near lakes, pools, rivers and streams in high Arctic tundra or the taiga forest zone (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Taiga nesting populations show a preference for scrubby birch (Betula spp.) forest and dense spruce forest with bogs or mires (Madge and Burn 1988), whereas tundra-based populations nest on damp tundra of moss, grass, sedge or scrub (Johnsgard 1978) near river flood-plains (but above flood levels) on Arctic islands and in Arctic coastal regions (Madge and Burn 1988). During the winter and on passage the species inhabits marshes, agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), damp steppe grassland (Madge and Burn 1988), flood-lands, rivers and coastal shallows (Snow and Perrins 1998) in open country. It also roosts on lakes, rivers and flood-lands in Europe during this season. Populations that breed in the taiga nest in early-May, with those breeding in the tundra nesting one month later in early-June (Kear 2005). The species builds a nest of vegetation in a shallow scrape on the ground and clutch size is generally four to six eggs. The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of herbs, grasses, sedges (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and mosses (Johnsgard 1978), complemented during the breeding season by berries. During the winter it feeds predominantly on agricultural land taking grain, beans, potatoes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and sprouting winter cereal crops (Kear 2005). This species is strongly migratory and travels between breeding grounds in the high Arctic to wintering grounds in the temperate and subtropical zones (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;The species declined in the past due to hunting (resulting in mortality, injury and disturbance) (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva et al. 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and habitat loss (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Habitat degradation due to oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), drainage, peat-extraction, changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and forest clearance is a threat to breeding areas in Russia (Grishanov 2006), Norway and Sweden (Madge and Burn 1988). The species also suffers from human persecution (Madge and Burn 1988) and is susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004). Climate change poses a potential threat longer term on breeding grounds, most likely particularly to tundra populations (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).
B67;Aythya_ferina;"This species requires well-vegetated eutrophic to neutral swamps, marshes, lakes and slow-flowing rivers with areas of open water and abundant emergent fringing vegetation. It also breeds on saline, brackish and soda lakes and occasionally even in sheltered coastal bays (Kear 2005). The breeding grounds are reoccupied from early March (in the south) to early May (in Siberia) (Scott and Rose 1996) with breeding starting from April-May.

The nest is a depression or shallow cup in a thick heap of vegetation positioned on the ground or over water and concealed in thick waterside vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), or on floating mats of reeds or other vegetation (Johnsgard 1978). Clutches are usually eight to ten eggs. The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of seeds, roots (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), rhizomes (Kear 2005) and the vegetative parts of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants, as well as aquatic insects and larvae, molluscs, crustaceans, worms, amphibians and small fish (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Northern populations of this species are highly migratory, with those breeding in the milder parts of western or southern Europe being sedentary or only making short-distance dispersal movements (Snow and Perrins 1998) governed by harsh weather conditions (Scott and Rose 1996).";;The species is threatened by disturbance from hunting (Evans and Day 2002, Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), water-based recreation (Fox et al. 1994, Kear 2005) and from machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000). It is also threatened by habitat destruction (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on its wintering grounds due to eutrophication (partially as a result of nutrient run-off from agricultural land) (Kear 2005). The species suffers from nest predation by American Mink (Neovison vison) in Poland (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003), and adults are poisoned by ingesting lead shot (Spain) (Mateo et al. 1998). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006). This species is hunted in Northern Ireland (Evans and Day 2002), Spain (Mateo et al. 1998) and Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006), and the eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B69;Aythya_fuligula;The species breeds in lowland regions and shows a preference for eutrophic waters (Kear 2005) with open water, islands for breeding (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and abundant marginal and emergent vegetation. It is common on large, freshwater lakes, ponds, reservoirs, gravel-pits and quiet stretches of wide slow-flowing rivers during this season. During the winter the species frequents large freshwater lakes (Kear 2005), reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and sheltered coastal locations such as brackish inland seas (Kear 2005) brackish lagoons, tidal bays (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migratory populations arrive on their breeding grounds from late-April (Kear 2005) where they breed in single pairs or loose groups (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The nest is constructed of vegetation and is placed in water (Kear 2005) on floating mats or islets (Flint et al. 1984), or on the ground on islands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) in rush or grass tussocks (Snow and Perrins 1998), under bushes or in the open amidst marsh-nesting gull or tern colonies (Kear 2005). The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005), feeding mainly on molluscs, gastropods, crustaceans and aquatic insects, as well as seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and grain (Kear 2005). In central and north-west Europe this species is mainly sedentary (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) although other populations are chiefly migratory (Madge and Burn 1988).;;The species is threatened by habitat degradation due to oil pollution, drainage, peat-extraction and changing land management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth (Grishanov 2006) and agricultural intensification (Kear 2005)) in breeding areas (Kear 2005, Grishanov 2006). It also suffers decreased reproductive success as a result of disturbance from increased recreational use of inland waterbodies (Kear 2005), machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000), hunting (Evans and Day 2002) and predation by American Mink (Neovison vison) on islands (Nordstrom et al. 2002). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006). The eggs of this species were (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B70;Aythya_marila;The species breeds in tundra, moorland regions (Kear 2005) and wooded tundra (Scott and Rose 1996) in the high Arctic, occupying small, shallow (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), freshwater lakes, pools and rivers (Kear 2005) with grassy shorelines and high densities of invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978). It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving. The species winters on shallow coastal waters (Kear 2005) less than 10 m deep (Scott and Rose 1996) as well as sheltered bays, estuaries and brackish coastal lagoons. It is also found inland on large lakes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and reservoirs during this season (Madge and Burn 1988). It breeds in the high Arctic from late-May or early-June (depending on the timing of the Arctic thaw) (Kear 2005) in single pairs or loose groups (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), often with colonies of nesting gulls or terns (Kear 2005) although it is not itself a colonial species (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground close to water, either in thick vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978). Clutch size is normally 8–11 eggs. The species is omnivorous. Its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs but also includes laver shells (Hydrobia), insects, aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans, worms, small fish, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges and water weeds. This species is fully migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996), with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988).;;The species is susceptible to oil pollution (Kirby et al. 1993, Kear 2005) when moulting and in winter and may be threatened by high levels of organochloride contaminants (Kear 2005). Its habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in the winter also puts it at risk from other pollution types (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Oil and gas exploration have caused habitat loss in European Russia and losses of feeding opportunities in some wintering areas through the over-harvesting of mussels and cockles, eutrophication and offshore windfarms are also considered possible threats. (Jensen 2009). Large numbers often drown due to entanglement in fishing nets (Kirby et al. 1993). It is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted legally for sport in seven countries of the European Union (Kear 2005) (e.g. Denmark [Bregnballe et al. 2006]) and suffers from disturbance from hunting (Evans and Day 2002). In Sweden the presence of Mink (Mustela vison) has probably contributed to the decline of birds on the Stockholm archipelago (Jensen 2009).
B68;Aythya_nyroca;The species shows a strong preference for fresh standing water (Snow and Perrins 1998, N. Petkov in litt. 2008). It frequents shallow pools and marshes with abundant emergent, floating and shoreline vegetation such as reeds, willows and alders. In the breeding season, it also frequents saline, brackish or alkaline lakes in some areas, e.g. in Hungary, also well-managed fishponds are important summer habitat locally. Outside breeding season, it may frequent larger lakes, including inland seas, reservoirs, lagoons and coastal marshes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Generally breeding commences April to May in central Europe and Turkey, but can commence as early as February in southern Europe and as late as end of June in northern areas of its range (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It breeds in single pairs or loose groups. The nest is a low platform (Snow and Perrins 1998) of reeds, grass and leaves (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) placed on the ground or on an islet or hummock in thick vegetation close to water (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). Alternatively nests may be placed over water on floating mats of vegetation or in dense reedbeds along the shoreline (Johnsgard 1978). Clutches are usually 8-10 eggs. Although the species is omnivorous, plant material such as seeds, roots and vegetative parts of aquatic plants dominates its diet. Animal matter taken includes worms, molluscs, crustaceans, insects and larvae, amphibians and small fish. This species is chiefly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), although little is known about its migratory routes (Scott and Rose 1996). Adults undertake a wing moulting period on the breeding grounds between July and August (Robinson and Hughes 2006) and departure from the breeding grounds begins in mid- to late-August (N. Petkov in litt. 2008). The return migration to the breeding grounds begins in early March (Scott and Rose 1996).;;The species is threatened by the degradation and destruction of well-vegetated shallow pools and other wetland habitats (Vinicombe 2000, Kear 2005, Robinson and Hughes 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (e.g. changes to the vegetation community, disruption of water regimes, siltation, and increased water turbidity (Robinson and Hughes 2006)) as a result of excessive drainage and water abstraction (Vinicombe 2000, Grishanov 2006, Robinson and Hughes 2006), peat extraction (Grishanov 2006), eutrophication (from inadequate sewage treatment and nutrient run-off (Robinson and Hughes 2006)), oil pollution (Grishanov 2006), dam and barrage construction, the building of infrastructure on flood-plains (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006) and river canalisation (Kear 2005). Changing land management practices such as reed cutting and burning during the breeding season (Petkov 2006), over-grazing (Robinson and Hughes 2006) decreased grazing and mowing of wet meadows (Grishanov 2006), and abandonment (causing succession to scrub) or intensification (causing reversion to open water) of extensively managed fishponds (Vinicombe 2000, Kear 2005, Petkov 2006, Robinson and Hughes 2006) also threatens the species. The introduction of non-native species has caused further habitat degradation. For example the stocking of lakes with and accidental introduction of Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) has resulted in reductions in macrophyte biomass and corresponding reductions in invertebrate biomass (Kear 2005, Robinson and Hughes 2006), and in Bulgaria an introduced shrub (Desert False Indigo (Amorpha fruticosa)) is changing the ecological character of wetlands (Robinson and Hughes 2006). Increased drought due to global climate change may pose a threat to the species in part of its range (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006). Disturbance by fishing boats and anglers alongside fringe vegetation could cause abandonment of the breeding sites or disrupt the timing of breeding (N. Petkov in litt. 2008). Hunting is another serious threat to the species (Vinicombe 2000, Robinson and Hughes 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Large numbers are shot on passage in the autumn (e.g. through the Volga delta) (Kear 2005, Balmaki and Barati 2006). Illegal and accidental hunting also persists in most European countries. Other lower-level threats include lead poisoning (from ingestion of discarded lead shot), fires in areas of reed thickets, peat bogs and woods (Grishanov 2006), entanglement and drowning in fishing nets (Robinson and Hughes 2006) and hybridisation with native species (e.g. Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) and Common Pochard (Aythya farina) in Switzerland (Leuzinger 2010)).
B54;Branta_bernicla;The species breeds in coastal Arctic tundra (Carboneras et al. 2014) in or close to wet coastal meadows with abundant grassy vegetation (Kear 2005) and on tundra-covered flats with tidal streams (only just above the high tide line). In some parts of its range it shows a preference for nesting on small grassy islands (Johnsgard 1978) in tundra lakes and rivers. High Arctic nesters may also breed widely dispersed over icy tundra, well-away from water (Kear 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species becomes predominantly coastal, inhabiting estuaries, sandy shores (Carboneras et al. 2014), tidal mudlflats (Madge and Burn 1988), coastal saltmarshes, and shallow muddy bays (Kear 2005). In recent years the species has taken to grazing on coastal cultivated grasslands (Madge and Burn 1988) and winter cereal fields (Scott and Rose 1996), but rarely occurs on freshwater wetlands except on passage. It arrives on the breeding grounds in early June where it may breed in small, loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988) or dispersed in single pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground. Although the species often nests close to water (Carboneras et al. 2014) typically within a few hundred metres of the tideline (Snow and Perrins 1998), high Arctic nesters may breed on icy tundra well away from water (Kear 2005). Clutch size is typically three to five eggs. The species is mainly herbivorous although it may take animal matter. In its breeding habitat the diet of the species generally consists of grasses, mosses, lichens and aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2014), although the young may also take insects and aquatic invertebrates (Johnsgard 1978). Breeding success is highly dependent on the lemming cycle. Effectively only once every three years (the lemming peak years) is breeding success relatively high. Outside of the breeding season the species predominantly takes marine algae, seaweeds and other aquatic plants linked with salt or brackish water (Carboneras et al. 2014). This species is fully migratory, the main routes of migration being along Arctic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;This species is threatened by hunting (Kear 2005) which has caused severe declines in the past, although hunting bans have allowed it to begin to recover (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is susceptible to disturbance from vehicles in the U.K. (Burton et al. 2002) (although it is relatively tolerant of human disturbance, e.g. walkers, compared to other species) (Vickery and Gill 1999, Burton et al. 2002). In its winter range the species may be persecuted by farmers as in recent years it has increasingly taken to grazing on cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields near the coast (Scott and Rose 1996). The species may also be threatened in the future by reductions in abundance of sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) and eelgrasses (Zostera) (Clausen et al. 2012). It can use alternative feeding sources as demonstrated following the collapse of eelgrasses in the Netherlands (1930-1940), but these need to be highly nutritious and diverse. It has been shown that nest success is dependent on fat reserves that have been acquired in the staging areas (Ebbinge & Spaans 1995). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) predation (Madsen et al. 1992), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Inbreeding depression has also been identified as a threat to current population growth (Harrison et al. 2011).
B53;Branta_leucopsis;"The species breeds in Arctic semi-desert tundra (fjellmark) (Kear 2005) on crags, rocky outcrops (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), cliffs, rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1978) and coastal islands (Svalbard) (Kear 2005) near wetlands such as lakes, rivers, marshes, the upper parts of fjords, coastlines (Johnsgard 1978), wet meadows and mudflats (Kear 2005). In years when the snow is slow to melt the species first forages on grassy vegetation on south-facing mountain slopes fertilised by the droppings of cliff-nesting seabirds before moving down to breeding areas (Kear 2005a). During the non-breeding season the species frequents tidal mudflats, saltmarshes and adjacent coastal meadows (Johnsgard 1978), with agricultural fields becoming increasingly more important as winter feeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996). It is present on its breeding grounds from May or June to August or September (Kear 2005) where it breeds in small but often closely packed colonies (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) of 5-50 pairs, occasionally singly or in groups of up to 150 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). It uses the same nesting sites year after year (Johnsgard 1978). The nest is a shallow depression lined with grass, moss, lichen and down, with thick layer of droppings around rim found on cliff ledges or on ground on coastal islands, although Svalbard birds also traditionally nested on cliffs or hillsides in larger valleys. Usually three to five eggs are laid. The species is herbivorous; its diet consisting of the leaves, stems and seed-heads of grasses, sedges, aquatic plants. It may also take agricultural grain and vegetables during the winter (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). This species is fully migratory and travels on a narrow front (Kear 2005) between extremely localised breeding and wintering areas (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).";;Adults of this species, eggs and down were once exploited by humans (Kear 2005), and the species may be disturbed by shooting even though it is not directly hunted (Peberdy 1991). The species faces possible threats from persecution (disturbance) by farmers as in winter it favours grasslands and pastures used for grazing livestock (Cope et al. 2003). The species also suffers from nest predation by arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) in Svalbard (Madsen et al. 1992).
B78;Bucephala_clangula;The species is restricted to water close to the shore and less than 10 m deep (Scott and Rose 1996). When breeding the species shows a preference for oligotrophic lakes devoid of fish (Kear 2005) but with abundant invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978), and requires tree-holes (or artificial nestboxes) for nesting. Suitable habitats include freshwater lakes, pools, rivers (Carboneras et al. 2014) and deep marshes (Johnsgard 1978) surrounded by coniferous forest (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species winters mainly at sea (Scott and Rose 1996) on inshore waters, estuaries, coastal lagoons (Carboneras et al. 2014) and shallow bays (Kear 2005), especially in the vicinity of sewage outfalls (Carboneras et al. 2014). Further to the south and on migration the species may also frequent large rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996). The species breeds from April in solitary pairs. The species nests in hollows of mature trees (Carboneras et al. 2014) formed by woodpeckers or by bacterial or fungal heart-rot invasions (Kear 2005). The species will also nest in artificial nest boxes Clutches are usually between eight and eleven. It feeds predominantly on aquatic invertebrates such as molluscs, worms, crustaceans, aquatic insects and insect larvae, as well as amphibians, small fish and some plant material (mainly in the autumn) such as seeds, roots and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2014). Most of this species is fully migratory although it may only travel short distances (Kear 2005), but certain populations in the north-west of Europe may also be sedentary (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;"The species is very sensitive to habitat alterations. In the winter, the main threats for this species are from major oil incidents near the coast or from eating contaminated food (organochlorines and polychlorinated biphenyls are elevated in some important wintering areas), as large flocks will often gather to feed around sewer outfalls. The species is hunted sustainably in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006); however the impact of hunting of this species across its range is unknown, although an estimated 100,000–250,000 were once shot annually in north-west and central Europe. Lead shot ingestion however, does not appear to be a significant risk, at least compared to some other species of seaducks (Carboneras et al. 2014). Modern forestry management work is limiting as it does not favour the retention of old and decaying trees with likely nest holes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997)."
B79;Bucephala_islandica;The species uses relatively productive lakes and rivers in Iceland. It is a hole-nesting species using natural holes in lava fields and nest boxes erected on farmhouses at the edge of the breeding area (Tucker and Heath 1994).  It winters mainly on ice-free fresh water in the breeding area but small numbers winter on other partly ice-free fresh waters, mostly within the volcanic zone (Gardarsson 1978). Laying is usually from mid-May although slightly earlier if using nest boxes. It lays 8 to 11 eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is largely sedentary in Iceland (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014);;In Europe this species is mainly confined to NE Iceland, where 85–90% of the local population occurs at Lake Mývatn and on the River Laxá, and c. 50% of population disappeared in 1989 due to a crash in foraging resources (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Plans to introduce Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) into the river system (Einarsson and Magnúsdóttir 1993), along with sediment dredging that occurs, could negatively affect future food availability (Kear 2005). Eggs are harvested by local people but this is considered sustainable as each nest is subject to a quota. There is a comparatively large sexual imbalance in the Icelandic population with rarely more than 400 females available in any given breeding season (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).
B75;Clangula_hyemalis;"This species breeds on small tundra lakes, pools, bogs, rivers and coastal sites of the high Arctic. It winters mostly at sea, generally far offshore, but also inland in large, deep, freshwater lakes or brackish lagoons (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).

It breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in single pairs or loose groups (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The nest is a natural depression, or rock crevice, lined with surrounding plant matter and down, among vegetation or in the open and frequently close to water. Clutches are normally six to nine eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species shows a preference for marine foods (Johnsgard 1978). Its diet consists predominantly of animal matter (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as crustaceans, molluscs, other marine invertebrates, fish, and in fresh water, insects and their larvae; also a little plant material. The species is migratory, moving in large flocks at night. Many birds winter at sea in the far northern regions, generally as far south as Britain, the Danube River and the Black Sea. Birds leave their breeding grounds in the first half of October and return mid-March (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014)."; It generally avoids wooded tundra, although in north Scandinavia it does reach the arctic-alpine zone among willows and dwarf birch.;The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss from petroleum pollution, wetland drainage and peat-extraction (Grishanov 2006). It is also threatened with direct mortality from oil pollution (Gorski et al. 1977, Kirby et al. 1993, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), drowning through entanglement in fishing nets (Kirby et al. 1993, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and from hunting on migration routes over certain regions of the Arctic (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species has previously suffered heavy losses from an outbreak of avian cholera (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. There is evidence that the species is experiencing low reproductive success on its Arctic breeding grounds. The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites shows that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (e.g. Hario et al. 2009, Ellermaa et al. 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality. The breeding success of this (and other) species seems to have declined since the mid-1990s, when the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle in the abundance of Arctic rodents collapsed, probably due to climate change. With fewer rodents around, Arctic predators now take a heavier toll on breeding birds every year, instead of only once every 3-4 years. However, the main reason for low breeding productivity seems likely to be connected mainly with skipped breeding, rather than with increased predation pressure, possibly owing to worsened female body condition (A. Kondratyev in litt. 2012). A decline in breeding productivity is supported by unpublished data on the age ratio of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic, which suggest a decline in breeding success by c.75% from prior to 1990 until c. 2000 (J. Bellebaum in litt. 2012). Drastic declines on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 are thought to be connected to the natural cycles of the species, pollution from oil and gas extractions, and pollution from the deposition of nuclear and chemical waste in northern seas (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). In 2006-2007, on the Hatpudirskaya Bay coast (Barents Sea), several thousand dead C. hyemalis were found washed-up on beaches (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). The species is hunted for sport in several countries including Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006).
B46;Cygnus_columbianus;"This species breeds near shallow pools, lakes and broad slow-flowing rivers with emergent littoral vegetation and pondweeds (e.g. Potamogeton spp.) connected to coastal delta areas in open, moist, low-lying sedge-grass or moss-lichen Arctic tundra (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). On migration the species frequents shallow ponds, lowland and upland lakes, reservoirs, riverine marshes, shallow saline lagoons and sheltered coastal bays and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). During the winter it inhabits brackish and freshwater marshes (Madge and Burn 1988), rivers, lakes, ponds and shallow tidal estuarine areas with adjacent grasslands, flooded pastures or agricultural arable fields (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013, Kear 2005) below 100 m (Snow and Perrins 1998).

It arrives on the breeding grounds from early-May to late-June (Madge and Burn 1988) (depending on local conditions (Kear 2005)) where it breeds well-dispersed (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single pairs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), occasionally nesting semi-colonially in optimum habitats (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). The nest is a large mound of plant matter positioned on elevated ground (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) such as a ridge or hummock, often at some distance from feeding pools to reduce the risk of flooding (Kear 2005). Clutch size is generally three to five eggs. The species is predominantly herbivorous, feeding on seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, rhizomes and stems of aquatic plants (e.g. Potamogeton,Zostera and Glyceria spp.), grasses (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), sedge and herbaceous tundra vegetation (Kear 2005). This species is fully migratory and travels on a narrow front via specific routes using well-known stop-over sites (Madge and Burn 1988) between its Arctic breeding and temperate wintering grounds (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).";It rarely nests in shrub tundra, and generally avoids forested areas (Kear 2005). ;The species is threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitats due to drainage (Kear 2005) (e.g. for agriculture (Grishanov 2006)), petroleum pollution, peat extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub overgrowth), the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006) and eutrophication (Kear 2005). The NW European population is thought to be particularly sensitive to land-use change as well as climate change due to its narrow breeding distribution across the Russian high Arctic and its high dependency on a small number of stop-over sites during spring and autumn migration (Nagy et al. 2012).  Its Arctic breeding habitat is also threatened by oil and gas exploration (Kear 2005). The species is threatened by mortality from oil pollution (oil spills) in moulting and pre-migrational staging areas, from collisions with powerlines and wind turbines, and from lead poisoning as a result of lead shot (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and fishing weight ingestion during migration and on wintering grounds (Kear 2005). The species suffers from poaching in north-west Europe and is hunted considerably for subsistence throughout its range (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B45;Cygnus_cygnus;The species breeds on islands in or along the banks of shallow freshwater pools, lakes, slow-flowing rivers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), marshes, swamps and bogs, showing a preference for habitats with abundant emergent vegetation (Kear 2005) and reedbeds in taiga (coniferous forest) zones, birch forest zones (Johnsgard 1978) and shrub/forest tundra (Kear 2005). Non-breeders may also be found in flocks on lakes, river channels and coastal bays (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). On migration the species frequents lakes, estuaries and sheltered coasts. It traditionally winters on freshwater lakes and marshes, brackish lagoons and coastal bays (Kear 2005), floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998), although low-lying coastal agricultural land (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and wet pastures (Snow and Perrins 1998) are now used increasingly (Kear 2005). It breeds from mid-May in solitary pairs with well-defined territories. The nest is a large mound of plant matter (del Hoyo et al. 1992) built on dry ground or in reedbeds (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on small islands in or along the edges of lakes, pools or rivers (Madge and Burn 1988). The same nest mound may be used over several years although it is often repaired and new material is added (Kear 2005). Clutch size is typically four or five eggs, although can be up to 12. The species is predominantly herbivorous, its diet consisting of grasses (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), the leaves, stems and roots of aquatic plants, sedges and horsetails (Equisetum spp.) (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). During the winter the species also takes agricultural grain, vegetables (e.g. potatoes and turnips (Johnsgard 1978) and acorns (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014)), and on the breeding grounds young birds often take adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1978). This species is predominantly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;The species is threatened by habitat degradation and loss. Threats to its habitats include agricultural expansion, wetland drainage for irrigation, overgrazing by livestock (e.g. sheep), the development of roads (Kear 2005) and chronic oil pollution from oil exploration and transportation. The species may suffer heavy losses from future oil spills (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), flying accidents (such as collisions with overhead lines (Kear 2005) or wind turbines (Larsen and Clausen 2002)), poisoning (Kear 2005) from lead shot ingestion (Spray and Milne 1988) and it is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is also threatened by hunting (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), nest destruction and by subsistence egg collecting (Gudmundsson 1979, Nikolaeva et al. 2006).
B44;Cygnus_olor;"The species inhabits a variety of lowland freshwater wetlands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) such as shallow lakes (Kear 2005), ponds (Madge and Burn 1988), lagoons, marshes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), reedbeds (Snow and Perrins 1998, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and slow-flowing rivers (Kear 2005) (showing a preference for clean, weed-filled streams over larger, polluted rivers) (Johnsgard 1978). It is also common on artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs, gravel-pits, ornamental lakes (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013), ditches (Snow and Perrins 1998) and canals (Scott and Rose 1996), and will graze on grassland and agricultural land (e.g. arable cereal fields) (Kear 2005). Moulting congregations of adults and non-breeders (Snow and Perrins 1998) may also utilise brackish or saline habitats (Johnsgard 1978) including brackish marshes (Kear 2005), estuaries and sheltered coastal sites (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and bays (Madge and Burn 1988).

The species breeds during the local spring as isolated pairs in well-defended territories. The nest is a large mound of aquatic vegetation placed close to or floating on shallow water or amongst reeds (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). Breeding pairs often re-use nesting sites from previous years if it was successful (Johnsgard 1978). Usually five to seven eggs are laid at two-day intervals. Its diet consists predominantly of leaves and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants and grasses (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978) and grain, occasionally also taking small amphibians and aquatic invertebrates (e.g. molluscs, insects and worms). Truly wild populations of this species are migratory (particularly where displaced by cold weather) (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) although European and feral populations are essentially sedentary or only locally migratory or nomadic (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).";;The species suffers heavy losses from lead poisoning due to ingested lead fishing weights (Kelly and Kelly 2004), lead shot (Spray and Milne 1988) and lead-contaminated sediments from mining and smelting activities (Day et al. 2003). Heavy losses have also been recorded from local incidences of copper poisoning (Kobayashi et al. 1992). The ingestion of or entanglement in fishing lines and/or hooks can also cause severe injury or mortality (Kelly and Kelly 2004) as can collisions with overhead lines (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) although European and feral populations are essentially sedentary or only locally migratory). The species may be threatened by future oil spills (which can cause death by oil saturation) (Berglund et al. 1963). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (e.g. strain H5N1) (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Nagy et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus. Significant mortality can occur with prolonged freezing weather in winter which prevents birds from feeding (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).
B74;Histrionicus_histrionicus;The species is a river specialist during the breeding season and winters along exposed rocky seashores. Laying occurs in May and June. It nests on small islands in rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994). The nest is a thin layer of grass occasionally with a few dry twigs and leaves and lined with down (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013) and is usually concealed in dense vegetation (Tucker and Heath 1994). It usually lays five to seven eggs (Kear 2005). In summer the species occurs at high densities around lake outlets where it feeds on its favoured food resource: blackfly (Simulium vittatum) larvae (Bengtson and Ulfstrand 1971, Gudmundsson 1971). It also takes molluscs (Kear 2005). In summer it feeds on insect larvae and pupae, other invertebrates and small fish (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). In winter it forages along exposed rocky seashores where it feeds on intertidal and subtidal invertebrates (Tucker and Heath 1994). In Iceland birds from the north and north-east of the island move to the west and south-west coasts in winter (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).;;"In Europe, the species is threatened by the development of hydroelectric schemes which result in the diversion and siltation of rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013); one colony may have been lost through the diversion of the River Thorisos. The large-scale introduction of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo samar) and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) can result in competition for blackfly larvae and pupae, the ducks main food source. In the 1930s American Mink (Mustela vison) were introduced and subsequently escaped; these may have reduced breeding success although this has not been studied (Tucker and Heath 1994). Oils spills have been known to cause significant mortality outside of Europe (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). Also dredging for minerals in Lake Mývatn may affect algae blooms which form an important food source (Tucker and Heath 1994)."
B58;Anas_penelope;This species breeds in lowland freshwater marshes, slow-flowing large rivers (Kretchmar 1994) and shallow lakes and lagoons with ample submerged, floating and emerging vegetation (Kear 2005). Ideal wetland habitats for this species are those surrounded by sparse open forest, woodland and especially agricultural land (Kretchmar 1994, Kear 2005), in the boreal and subarctic zone (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005). In the non-breeding season this species shows a preference for coastal salt-marshes, freshwater, brackish and saline lagoons, flooded grasslands, estuaries, intertidal mudflats (Cramp and Simmons 1977), and other sheltered marine habitats (Kear 2005). The breeding season is from April to June, varying across its range according to latitude, with nests sometimes initiated in April in Scotland, but may not arrive on breeding grounds in northern Russia until the second half of May (Carboneras et al. 2014). The nests of this species are shallow depressions in the ground lined with vegetation, usually positioned not far from water and well concealed under overhanging vegetation, in grass tussocks, scrub (Kear 2005), and especially in heather (Jacobsen and Ugelvik 1998). Usually eight or nine eggs are laid (Carboneras et al. 2014).It is vegetarian and consumes the leaves, seeds, stems and root bulbs of pond weeds, fine grasses (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979), horsetails (Kretchmar 1994) and eelgrass, as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978). Animal material is taken rarely and usually incidentally along with vegetation or seeds (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979, Kear 2005). The species is strongly migratory, undertaking significant cold weather movements of varying magnitude (Scott and Rose 1996).;It avoids tundra, densely forested and mountainous country, as well as fast flowing rivers and streams, but tolerates saline or alkaline steppe lakes and wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). ;This species is susceptible to disturbance from freshwater recreational activities (Grishanov 2006, Carboneras et al. 2014) (e.g. tourists walking) (Mathers et al. 2000), pollution, petroleum pollution (Grishanov 2006)), wetland drainage (Grishanov 2006, Carboneras et al. 2014), peat-extraction (e.g. in the Kaliningrad region of Russia), changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006). Avian influenza virus (strain H5N1) is also a potential threat (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Jonassen and Handeland 2007), as is poisoning from the ingestion of lead shot pellets (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). This species is hunted for sport (e.g. in the U.K.) (Kear 2005, Carboneras et al. 2014), and although population numbers in an area decrease significantly after a period of shooting, there is no current evidence that such utilisation poses an immediate threat to the species (Vaananen 2001, Bregnballe et al. 2006). The eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B59;Anas_strepera;The species inhabits highly productive (Carboneras et al. 2014) and eutrophic (Snow and Perrins 1998) freshwater marsh or lake habitats (Carboneras et al. 2014) in open lowland grassland (Madge and Burn 1988), showing a preference for sheltered, shallow, standing or slow-flowing waters with abundant emergent vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) and grass-covered islands providing cover for nesting. It may also be found on permanent, shallow, slightly alkaline marshes (Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras et al. 2014), as well as on oxbow lakes, channels (Flint et al. 1984), reservoirs and gravel-pits (Kear 2005). After hatching, females move their broods to deeper marshes or to the edges of large impoundments, sometimes more than 1 mile away from the nesting sites (Johnsgard 1978). Breeding begins in April and May, with egg-laying generally from second half of April in northern and central Europe and during early May in Turkey (Carboneras et al. 2014). The nest is a well-hidden (Johnsgard 1978) hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) in grass and leaves positioned on the ground in thick vegetation (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species shows a preference for dense, dry herbaceous vegetation (Johnsgard 1978) and often nests far from water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). Clutch size is generally eight to twelve eggs. The species is predominantly herbivorous consuming mostly the seeds, leaves, roots and stems of aquatic plants (Carboneras et al. 2014) (submerged and emergent) as well as grasses and stoneworts (Chara spp.). The species is strongly migratory in the north of its range (Kear 2005) although breeding populations in temperate regions are largely sedentary (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;The species is threatened by pollution (Kear 2005) and disturbance from recreational use of freshwater wetlands (Kear 2005, Pease et al. 2005). It also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002) and nest predation by American Mink (Neovison vison) (Europe) (Opermanis et al. 2001). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted throughout most of its range, but is rarely taken in large numbers except where it is particularly abundant (Kear 2005). The eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B65;Marmaronetta_angustirostris;This species frequents shallow brackish or freshwater pools and marshes with abundant emergent and submergent vegetation in arid country, including seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It starts breeding between April and July (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and usually nests in dense reedbeds although in Spain it also uses clumps of saltmarsh vegetation (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is monogamous and will nest in single pairs or loose groups. The nest is a slight depression on the ground, lined with grass and down, normally close to water but occasionally over it (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Clutches range from 5-20 eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In Spain the mean clutch size was recorded to be 11.8 (Green 1998). Diet varies considerably between seasons and sites and additionally with age. Diptera are an important component of the diet, especially before and during the breeding season. Small seeds become increasingly important after the breeding season with faeces of post-breeding birds in Turkey composing of 95% dry weight Scirpus seeds (Green and Selva 2000, Green and Sánchez 2003, Fuentes et al. 2004). This species is dispersive and partially migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It shows variable, nomadic movements and is capable of dispersal in search of suitable habitat at any time of year as changing conditions require (Scott and Rose 1996). In winter it can be found at a number of sites around the Mediterranean basin where it does not normally breed (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;Over 50% of suitable habitat may have been destroyed during the 20th century. Wetland drainage for agriculture occurs across its range. Hydrological work has severely affected breeding sites in Turkey and Spain. Reed-cutting, reed-burning and grazing commonly reduce the amount of habitat for nesting. Pollution from agricultural, industrial and domestic sources is a threat at many sites. When breeding, it is vulnerable to shooting and egg collection. Further mortality results from birds caught in fishing nets and lead poisoning (Mateo et al. 2001, Svanberg et al. 2006). A lack of habitat following hot, dry summer months probably results in high juvenile and adult mortality post-breeding (Green 2000, 2007). Lack of water availability for the El Hondo reservoirs in Alicante have led to a major decline in Spain since 1998 (Ballesteros et al. 2008).
B77;Melanitta_fusca;This species winters mainly at sea, most commonly along exposed shores or offshore, although it is occasionally recorded inland during this period. Breeding occurs at middle to high altitudes in boreal forest and wooded tundra near to fresh water (Tucker and Heath 1994) and begins from mid-May (Madge and Burn 1988). A small relict population in Turkey is recorded breeding at around 3000 m on islands in high-altitude water-bodies, including crater lakes. It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups and is seasonally monogamous (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). Nests are a shallow depression on the ground, poorly lined with plant matter and down and found among vegetation. Clutch size is normally seven to nine eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, annelids, insects and small fish. In addition it may also consume plant material while on its breeding grounds. The species is migratory and small populations winter in the North Sea, the north-west Mediterranean, the Black Sea, along the Atlantic coast to Spain, and less commonly in freshwater lakes in central Europe. However the majority winter in the Baltic Sea (Tucker and Heath 1994).;;Moulting and wintering concentrations of this species are very susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (Gorski et al. 1977, Kear 2005, UICN France 2011, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (an oil spill could destroy a large proportion of the global population if it occurred in a key moulting or wintering area (Madge and Burn 1988)). The species is also susceptible to the effects of commercial exploitation of marine benthic organisms and shellfish (Kear 2005), and is threatened by drowning in fishing nets (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014, Kear 2005). It is threatened by habitat degradation as a result of the human exploitation of natural resources in the taiga and lower tundra regions of its breeding range (Kear 2005), and by lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Armenia) (Balian et al. 2002). It is susceptible to disturbance from tourism in remote coastal and freshwater habitats in its breeding range (Kear 2005), as well as disturbance from wind farms (wind turbines) (Garthe and Huppop 2004). The species suffers predation from American mink (Neovison vison) on islands (Nordstrom et al. 2002) and is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is a target of hunters in some areas (e.g. Bregnballe et al. 2006).
B76;Melanitta_nigra;The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and slow-flowing rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) with low banks (Flint et al. 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys or among mossy bogs (Flint et al. 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration the majority moult and overwinter at sea on shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs. The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) close to water or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005). Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter, although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans, worms (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), echinoderms, isopods, amphipods (Kear 2005) and insects as well as small fish (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter such as seeds, roots and tubers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint et al. 1984). This species is strongly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;The large concentrations of this species that occur during the moulting period and in winter are highly vulnerable to oil spills (Gorski et al. 1977, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), chronic oil pollution, human disturbance and the degradation of food resources as a result of oil exploration (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). The species also suffers disturbance from high-speed ferries (Larsen and Laubek 2005) and populations wintering off the coasts of western Europe are threatened by offshore wind farms (Kear 2005, Fox and Petersen 2006, Petersen 2006). The effects of commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish also poses a threat (through competition for food resources), and the species's breeding habitats are threatened by eutrophication in some areas (Kear 2005). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted in some areas (e.g. Bregnballe et al. 2006) and its eggs used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B80;Mergellus_albellus;It breeds on freshwater oligotrophic lakes, pools, oxbow lakes, backwaters of large slow-flowing rivers, muskegs (bogs) (Kear 2005) and flooded riverside woods (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998) in the coniferous and mixed deciduous/evergreen forest zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It shows a preference for shallow water, and requires mature broadleaved trees with holes in which to nest (Johnsgard 1978). The species overwinters on large freshwater lakes, brackish coastal lagoons, estuaries (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), reservoirs (Johnsgard 1978), ice-free rivers (Kear 2005) and sheltered coastal bays (Madge and Burn 1988) (although rarely on the open sea) (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), often resting and feeding on small bodies of water or small streams when on passage (Kear 2005). It arrives on the breeding grounds from April (Kear 2005) or early-May and breeds from mid-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988). The species nests in tree hollows (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) up to 10 m or more above the ground (Kear 2005) in mature broadleaved trees (Johnsgard 1978). It may also nest in artificial nest boxes. Typically it lays seven to nine eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). During the breeding season its diet consists predominantly of benthic aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval, crustaceans, molluscs and polychaete worms, as well as fish (Kear 2005), amphibians and plant matter. During the winter and in early spring however the species mainly feeds on fish. This species is highly migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;Where it occurs in large numbers on coastal waters the species is particularly vulnerable to oil pollution (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Populations declined in Europe throughout the 19th and 20th centuries due to habitat degradation and loss (e.g. the loss of mature trees in river valleys as a result of logging, conversion to agriculture and river canalisation). The species has also suffered local declines as a result of predation by American mink (Neovison vison) (Kear 2005) and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is susceptible to a certain amount of hunting pressure when on passage and during the winter (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Climate change is also affecting the range of this species (Pavón-Jordán et al. 2015).
B82;Mergus_merganser;The species breeds on large clear freshwater lakes, pools, the upper reaches of rivers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and streams in the boreal, montane (Kear 2005) and temperate forest zones (Johnsgard 1978). It requires waters with a fairly high productivity of fish surrounded by mature hardwood trees with holes excavated by woodpeckers or natural cavities for nesting in (Kear 2005). The species winters on large unfrozen lakes, rivers, lagoons, brackish waters and marshesThe species arrives on its breeding areas between March and May (Scott and Rose 1996), actually breeding as early as late-March (although often considerably later in more northerly regions) (Madge and Burn 1988).The species nests in holes excavated by large woodpeckers or natural cavities in mature hardwood trees with entry holes more than 15 m above the ground (Kear 2005). When natural tree-nesting sites are not available the species will use artificial nestboxes (Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) or may nest in rock clefts (Flint et al. 1984), among tree roots in undercut banks, on cliff ledges or in dense scrub or loose boulders on islands (Kear 2005). Clutches are usually eight to twelve eggs. Its diet consists predominantly of fish, but may also include aquatic invertebrates (such as molluscs, crustaceans, worms, and adult and larval insects), amphibians, small mammals and birds (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Northern breeding populations of this species are fully migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998) although breeders in temperate regions are sedentary or only travel short distances (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;, generally avoiding highly saline waters (Madge and Burn 1988) although it may move to estuaries, coastal lagoons and sheltered sea coasts with waters less than 10 m deep in particularly harsh winters (Scott and Rose 1996). ;The species is subject to persecution by anglers and fish-farmers who accuse it of depleting fish stocks (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species is also threatened by the degradation of freshwater lakes through drainage and petroleum pollution in Russia (Grishanov 2006). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted in Russia (Grishanov 2006) (although it is not a popular game bird (Kear 2005)), and its eggs used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B81;Mergus_serrator;The species breeds along the wooded shorelines (Kear 2005) of deep lakes, small rivers and streams (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) with moderate currents, in the tundra, boreal and temperate forest zones, as well as on more saline waters such as sheltered shallow bays, inlets, straits or estuaries with sandy rather than muddy substrates. It shows a preference for narrow channels rather than open expanses of water, with islands or islets and spits, projecting rocks or grassy banks (Snow and Perrins 1998). The majority of the species winters at sea, frequenting both inshore and offshore waters, estuaries, bays and brackish lagoons (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) but showing a preference for clear, shallow waters not affected by heavy wave action (Johnsgard 1978). It will also utilise large freshwater lakes on passage (Madge and Burn 1988). It breeds from April or May (later in northern populations) (Kear 2005). The nest is constructed within 25 m of water in a variety of locations such as natural cavities on the ground, burrows (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), under boulders (Madge and Burn 1988), amongst tree or scrub roots (Snow and Perrins 1998), in tree cavities, artificial nest boxes (Madge and Burn 1988), amongst reeds or on floating reed mats (Flint et al. 1984).  Clutch size is normally eight to ten. Its diet consists predominantly of small, shoaling marine or freshwater fish, as well as small amounts of plant material and aquatic invertebrates. This species is fully migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) although in temperate regions it only undertakes short distance movements to nearby coasts (Scott and Rose 1996);;The species is subject to persecution and may be shot by anglers and fish-farmers who accuse it of depleting fish stocks. It is also threatened by accidental entanglement and drowning in fishing nets (Kear 2005). Alterations to its breeding habitats by dam construction and deforestation, and habitat degradation from water pollution are other major threats to the species (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), although it may not be a popular game species (Kear 2005). The eggs of the species also used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B66;Netta_rufina;The species inhabits inland deep fresh or brackish reed-fringed lakes, rivers or saline and alkaline lagoons (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) in open country, also occurring (less often) on estuaries, river deltas and other sheltered coastal habitats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on passage (Madge and Burn 1988) or during the winter (Scott and Rose 1996). It breeds from mid-April to early-June (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is constructed of roots, twigs and leaves near water (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on the ground in dense vegetation or on floating mats of vegetation amidst reedbeds (Johnsgard 1978).  Clutches are usually eight to ten eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Although the species usually breeds well-dispersed, neighbouring pairs may sometimes nest as close as 30 m apart (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The diet of this species consists predominantly of the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants, although it will occasionally take aquatic invertebrates (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species is a short-distance migrant (Tucker and Heath 1994).;;The two main threats to this species are habitat degradation (Defos du Rau 2002) (e.g. through land-use changes) and hunting (Kear 2005) (e.g. the species is hunted in France, Portugal and Spain without any official hunting bag monitoring (Defos du Rau 2002)).  Loss of habitat through wetland drainage is also a serious threat (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species also suffers poisoning from lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mateo et al. 1998). Deterioration in the water quality of wetlands can reduce the abundance of stonewort (Nitellopsis obtuse) which is an important part of the species's diet (Ruiters et al. 1994), and it is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B84;Oxyura_leucocephala;This species breeds in small, shallow, fresh to brackish wetlands with dense submerged vegetation and extensive reedbeds (Tucker and Heath 1994). Breeding begins in April with broods hatching mostly in June and July (Carboneras and Kirwan 2015). Nests are a platform of reed stems and leaves sparsely lined with down and are built in dense vegetation, on the ground or over water, often in old nests of other waterbirds. They are sometimes sited within gull and tern colonies, and birds will use specially constructed nest-boxes. Clutches are usually four to nine white eggs and females may re-lay if the first clutch is lost. As a diving duck, its diet consists of midge larvae and other aquatic invertebrates.  Seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants are also taken (Carboneras and Kirwan 2015). Most birds are migratory, wintering in Europe from further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. Breeding in Europe is mostly concentrated in Spain where the population is resident but also occurs in Russia and Turkey (Tucker and Heath 1994).;;The greatest long-term threat to the species's survival is thought to be competition and introgressive hybridisation (i.e. genetic swamping) with the non-native North American Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) (Green and Hughes 1996, Green and Hughes 2001, Muñoz-Fuentes et al. 2007). Both male Ruddy Ducks and male hybrids are socially dominant over male White-headed Ducks during courtship (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996). The threat from the Ruddy Duck is extremely serious, given that, if allowed to proceed beyond a certain point, the Ruddy Duck's spread across the Palearctic will become unstoppable, especially if the species was allowed to become established in White-headed Duck range-states such as Turkey or the Russian Federation, where the huge size and area of the wetlands and their infrequent monitoring would make control impossible (Hughes et al. 2006). Approximately 50% of breeding habitat has been drained during the 20th century. Remaining sites are vulnerable to drainage, filling, pollution and disturbance. Water abstraction for agriculture and other uses has affected water levels in many important sites throughout the range. The genetic diversity of the western European population is low (Muñoz-Fuentez et al. 2005) owing to its having suffered a bottleneck in the 1970s and early 1980s when only a few dozen individuals remained in the wild (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996, Muñoz-Fuentez et al. 2005). This may lessen the adaptive potential of the population, rendering it less able to withstand environmental change (Muñoz-Fuentez et al. 2005). Further threats include drowning in fishing-nets, hunting and ingestion of lead shot (Green et al. 1996, J. Criado in litt. 1999, Mateo et al. 2001, A.A. Khan, A. Parveen, and R. Yasmeen in litt. 2005). The species is hunted illegally in most of the range states but this has not been quantified, apart from in Turkey. Hunting and egg collection are the most likely reason for extinction in some countries (Hughes et al. 2006).
B73;Polysticta_stelleri;This species very rarely breeds in Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Small numbers of birds winter in Europe, mostly at sea, along low-lying rocky coasts and frequenting bays and river mouths (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It feeds mostly by diving, chiefly consuming molluscs, crustaceans and other marine invertebrates as well as small fish and freshwater insects and larvae. The species is migratory, travelling 3,000 km to its moulting sites (Kear 2005), before some continue migration to more distant wintering sites (Petersen et al. 2006). It arrives at its wintering grounds in Europe between October and November and departs April to May (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Some birds remain at wintering sites over the summer (Kear 2005);;Over-hunting in Siberia and in other breeding areas may be impacting the population. Eiders breeding in Russia are subject to human subsistence harvesting and exposure to lead shot. Males are subject to particular hunting pressure as they arrive on the moulting grounds before females (Morse 2009). Increasing human habitation of Arctic regions has increased the range and numbers of ravens (Corvus corax) and some large gulls, leading to a greater risk of predation (Kear 2005). Recent dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness north of Alaska and Russia may affect eiders in unknown ways (Kear 2005). In addition, climate change is causing the loss of Arctic tundra ponds (Andresen  and Lougheed 2015), which could be contributing to declines in this species. Habitat loss also occurs through prospecting for, and the exploitation of, natural resources such as oil and gas (Kear 2005). The increasing traffic of tankers carrying oil from Arctic areas imposes the risk of contamination following spills (Kear 2005). It is not currently clear which of these many factors is driving the overall decline (K. Laing in litt. 2004, Žydelis et al. 2006).
B71;Somateria_mollissima;The species breeds on offshore islands and islets (Kear 2005) along low-lying rocky coasts (Carboneras et al. 2014), on coastal shores and spits, on islets in brackish and freshwater lagoons (Kear 2005), lakes and rivers (Johnsgard 1978) close to the sea (Kear 2005) or on tundra pools, rivers (Carboneras et al. 2014) and lakes (Madge and Burn 1988) up to 5 or 6 km inland (Kear 2005). It shows a preference for boulder-strewn or grassy islands (Johnsgard 1978) with sheltered approaches (Snow and Perrins 1998) that are safe from nest predators, although in the high Arctic where such shelter is unavailable more open sites must be used (in which case the species often nests in closely packed groups for protection) (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species typically winters on shallow seashores, bays and estuaries (Carboneras et al. 2014), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006). The species breeds from early-April (although the most northerly populations may not breed until mid-June (Madge and Burn 1988)), and generally nests in colonies. The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open. Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs although crustaceans, echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken. During the breeding season incubating females frequently complement their diet with algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (Carboneras et al. 2014). The majority of this species is migratory (Flint et al. 1984), with some populations e.g. in Europe being largely sedentary (Scott and Rose 1996).;;The species is vulnerable to chronic coastal oil pollution (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), especially oil spills (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva et al. 2006, Carboneras et al. 2014), in areas where large moulting and wintering concentrations occur (Carboneras et al. 2014). It also comes into conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry which depletes the species's food resources (Kear 2005, Ens 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006,) and has previously lead to mass starvation events due to the over-fishing of benthic molluscs (e.g. in the Dutch Wadden Sea) (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006). On the breeding grounds, disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and from local shore-based activities (e.g. angling, dog-walking (Keller 1991) and scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003)) increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species on its wintering grounds (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). The species commonly becomes entangled and drowned in monofilament nets (Kear 2005), and it is hunted unsustainably (Nikolaeva et al. 2006)
B72;Somateria_spectabilis;The species breeds on dry Arctic tundra near freshwater lakes, pools, bogs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), marshes (Kear 2005), streams (Madge and Burn 1988) and small rivers (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on the coast or up to 50 km (rarely up to 100 km) inland. It shows a preference for shallow fresh waters with emergent vegetation for initial brood rearing, afterwards moving to more saline waters where the young fledge. The species generally moults in sheltered fjords and bays with high densities of benthic fauna (Kear 2005), and winters at sea on deep offshore waters (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) close to the edge of sea ice or in coastal areas with shallow waters (Kear 2005). It breeds from late-June onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) usually in well-dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), although in some areas it may also form loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988). The nest is a slight hollow on dry ground and is usually positioned near water in the open or under the cover of driftwood, grass hummocks or rocks (Flint et al. 1984). Its diet consists predominantly of animal matter such as benthic molluscs, crustaceans, larval insects, echinoderms and other marine invertebrates, although the seeds and the vegetative parts of tundra plants, sedges and aquatic plants may also be taken on the breeding grounds (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), and algae, eelgrass Zostera spp. and Ruppia maritima may be taken at sea (Johnsgard 1978). It breeds from June onwards in solitary pairs. This species is fully migratory (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;The species is threatened by chronic coastal oil pollution (Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and future oil spills (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), especially where it forms large aggregations on the sea during the moult period, on migration or in the winter (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species is also threatened by the degradation of food resources as a result of oil exploration and by human disturbance when moulting and on migration, and is threatened by disturbance from uncontrolled shipping (e.g. oil transportation) on its wintering grounds (Nikolaeva et al. 2006).
B64;Anas_clypeata;It inhabits permanent shallow freshwater wetlands (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), preferred sites being those surrounded by dense stands of reeds or other emergent vegetation whilst being free of overhanging trees or fringing forest (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable habitats include well-vegetated lakes and marshes and with muddy shores and substrates in open country (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), as well as oxbow lakes, channels and swamps (former U.S.S.R.) (Flint et al. 1984). It also frequents artificial waters bordered by lush grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as sewage farms, rice-fields (Kear 2005) and fish ponds (Musil 2006). In the winter it can be found on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988), coastal shorelines, fresh and brackish estuarine marshes (Johnsgard 1978), inland seas and brackish or saline inland waters (Snow and Perrins 1998), occasionally occurring (briefly) on marine waters during migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998).  It arrives on the breeding grounds from March where it breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups in the northern spring (chiefly from mid-April to June). The nest is a scrape or depression (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) on the ground in tall grass, among hummocks, in the open (Flint et al. 1984) or (rarely) in bulrush marshes (Kear 2005). Normally between nine and eleven eggs are laid. Its diet consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects, molluscs, the seeds of emergent and aquatic plants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), planktonic crustaceans (Snow and Perrins 1998), annelids, amphibian spawn, tadpoles, spiders, fish and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982). This species is highly migratory although it may be present all year round in parts of Europe (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;;The species is threatened by habitat loss from drainage and changing farmland practices (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), is occasionally killed by collisions with power transmission lines (Malcolm 1982), and suffers from nest predation by American Mink (Neovison vison) (Opermanis et al. 2001, Nordstrom et al. 2002, Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003). It is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Forrester et al. 1980) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Camargue, France and Spain (Mateo et al. 1998, Mondain-Monval et al. 2002)). The species is a favoured quarry species throughout most of the world, but is rarely taken in large numbers (Kear 2005). It is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and the Po delta, Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006). The eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B63;Anas_querquedula;In the breeding season this species frequents small, shallow ponds and lakes with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (that is not too tall or dense, such as bulrush (Typha spp.)) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Green 1998), in grass dominated environments, like swampy meadows, flooded fields, shallow freshwater marshes (Johnsgard 1978, Schricke 2001, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It is a highly sociable and gregarious species, and regularly forms large congregations of several hundred on passage but whilst breeding can be found in single pairs or small groups (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Meadows are the favoured nesting areas of this species, with nests rarely located more than 150 m from water (usually within 20 m) (Cramp and Simmons 1977). The nest itself is a depression in the ground, typically situated under rushes or tall grasses (such as manna grass, Glyceria). Typically eight to eleven eggs laid (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). When breeding this species is omnivorous (Johnsgard 1978). In spring and summer its diet is dominated by animal matter: chiefly molluscs, aquatic insects and their larvae (waterbugs, caddisfly, water beetles, midges), crustaceans (ostracods and phyllopods especially), worms, leeches, young and spawn of frogs, and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Hockey et al. 2005). Seeds, roots, tubers, stems, leaves and buds of plants such as Hornwort Ceratophyllum, Naiad Najas, sedge, grass and other aquatic plants are also important at this time (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). During the non-breeding season the birds are mainly vegetarian (Treca 1981). This species is highly migratory, breeding widely across western Eurasia and wintering within the northern tropics. It migrates on a broad front, the autumn migration beginning in late July and peaking in August or early September (in Europe and Egypt). The spring migration begins in February, with birds beginning to arrive on breeding grounds from mid-March to early-May (Scott and Rose 1996).;, but not generally under shrubs (Johnsgard 1978, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014);The most significant threat encountered by this species on its breeding grounds in Europe is habitat deterioration through the drainage and reclamation of wetlands (Kear 2005), the increasing climatic aridity and subsequent lowering of the water table, and the transformation of wetlands to dammed reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996). Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows, increased human disturbance, lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005). The invasive species American Mink (Neovison vison) also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis et al. 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). This species is hunted in Denmark, but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe et al. 2006).
B56;Tadorna_ferruginea;This species frequents the shores of inland freshwater, saline and brackish lakes and rivers in open country, particularly those in open steppe, upland plateau and mountainous regions (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). However it is less dependent upon large water bodies for resting and feeding than most other Anatidae, and often occurs a considerable distance from water during the breeding season (Scott and Rose 1996). In the non-breeding season this species prefers streams, slow-flowing rivers, freshwater pools, flooded grasslands, marshes and brackish or saline lakes in lowland regions and is also found on artificial reservoirs (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard, 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Breeding occurs in single pairs or loose groups and in Europe eggs are laid from mid-March. Clutches are normally eight or nine eggs (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of tender green shoots and the seeds of terrestrial vegetation, agricultural grains such as millet and wheat, littoral crustaceans such as shrimps, aquatic and terrestrial insects (especially Locusts), aquatic molluscs, small fish, frogs, amphibian spawn and worms (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard, 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In Europe the species is chiefly sedentary or dispersive, undertaking local movements linked to the availability of suitable water (moving away from drought-affected areas or to temporary wetlands) (Tucker and Heath 1994, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).;It avoids coastal waters and tall, dense vegetation or emergent and floating aquatic plants (Madge and Burn 1988). ;Hunting is a threat, especially in south-east Europe (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005, Popovkina 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) (e.g. in Turkey) (Scott and Rose 1996). Other threats to western populations include the loss and degradation of inland wetlands through subterranean water extraction for irrigation (Popovkina 2006) (leading to decreasing water supplies for seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands), widespread drainage of shallow marshes and lakes (Scott and Rose 1996), salt extraction (Green et al. 2002, Popovkina 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014), urban development, pollution, introduction of exotic fish and overgrazing (Green et al. 2002, Popovkina 2006, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). At the Klingnau Dam in northern Switzerland the species has been known to hybridise with the South African Shelduck (Tadorna cana) from escaped captive populations, which could pose a threat to the integrity of both species (Owen et al. 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B57;Tadorna_tadorna;"The species shows a preference for saline habitats and frequents mudflats (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) and muddy or sandy estuaries in coastal regions, and occurs inland on saline and brackish lakes in steppe or semi-desert (Madge and Burn 1988). Breeding begins in April and May in single pairs or small groups.

The nest is commonly positioned in a tree-hollow (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014) up to 8 m above the ground (Kear 2005) or in a mammal burrow (Kear 2005, Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Rarely nests may also be placed in the open or in dense vegetation up to 1 km from water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). The species will also nest in artificial nest boxes (Kear 2005). Its diet consists predominantly of saltwater molluscs (e.g. Hydrobia spp.) as well as other aquatic invertebrates (e.g. insects, crustaceans and worms), small fish, fish spawn and plant material. Most populations of this species are migratory (although European populations are largely sedentary) and undertake extensive moult migrations to favoured moulting sites after breeding (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).";;The species is threatened by habitat loss as a result of tidal barrage schemes in Europe (Kear 2005, Burton 2006). It also suffers predation from American Mink (Neovison vison) on islands (Nordstrom et al. 2002) and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Its eggs used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).
B282;Upupa_epops;This species occupies open country such as pastures, parkland, orchards, sand-heathland, olive groves, and vineyards and requires the presence of features offering perches, shade, nest-sites and accessible food. It is frequently found around villages and in traditionally farmed areas. Breeding can occur up to 3,000 m in Turkey (Krištín and Kirwan 2014). In central and southern Europe, egg-laying occurs from late April or early May, although begins in January in the Canaries (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is monogamous, solitary and a territorial breeder, although extra-pair paternity has been found in southeast Spain. It nests in natural holes in stumps, trees, walls, old buildings, cliffs, among boulders, in abandoned vehicles, drainpipes, wells, roof spaces and nest boxes and may use the same site for several seasons (Krištín and Kirwan 2014). The nest may  unlined or lined with moss, grass, leaves or pine needles (Snow and Perrins 1998) and is normally relatively close to the ground but occasionally found over 40 m. (Krištín and Kirwan 2014). Typically lays seven to eight eggs. It feeds almost entirely on animal matter, primarily large insects and their larvae and pupae (Snow and Perrins 1998). Northern populations are fully migratory while others our only partially migratory. European populations winter in northwest Africa, the Canary Isles, Israel and Arabia (Krištín and Kirwan 2014).;;The species is hunted in Mediterranean region (Krištín and Kirwan 2014). Food quality and accessibility has been shown to affect reproductive success (Martin-Vivaldi et al. 1999, Fournier and Arlettaz 2001) as has the availability of suitable nesting cavities (Arlettaz et al. 2000) as a result of habitat changes after agricultural intensification (Bauer and Berthold 1997).
B274;Apus_affinis;"This species occurs over a wide range of habitats and latitudes, though less frequently in truly arid regions, and usually close to human habitation (Chantler and Boesman 2013). In Europe it breeds in Turkey (Snow and Perrins 1998). In Turkey nesting occurs from April to September (Kirwan et al. 2013). It typically nests on man-made structures in the angle between the roof and wall; eviction by House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) has been recorded (Chantler and Boesman 2013). Cliff sites and abandoned swallow (Hirundo) nests can be employed and forcible eviction noted (Chantler and Boesman 2013). The nest is a sturdy, untidy, yet internally neat and smooth, hemispherical 'bag' of vegetable matter, mainly grass, down and small twigs, with feathers, agglutinated with saliva; built in dense, often overlapping clusters with up to three entrances, sometimes communal (Chantler and Boesman 2013). It needs a perch to cling to while building (Chantler and Boesman 2013). It feeds on invertebrates, foraging as far as 15–20 km from the nest site on occasions (Chantler and Boesman 2013). It is migratory and only present in Turkey from March to September (Chantler and Boesman 2013).";;Dam construction leading to habitat loss may lead to the decrease of populations in Turkey (Kiziroglu 2008) and large declines (50%) (BirdLife International 2004).
B271;Apus_apus;The species inhabits a wide range of habitats from arid steppe, desert, temperate, Mediterranean and boreal zones. It breeds between March and June. In the U.K. it breeds mid-May to late July and a week earlier and later in Switzerland and Fenno-Scandia respectively. It typically lays one to four eggs. It nests mainly in buildings, but in remote parts of the range it also uses tree hollows and rock crevices. The nest cup is constructed of small pieces of vegetable matter and feathers, agglutinated with saliva. It feeds on insects and spiders. It is a long-distance migrant wintering in Africa mainly from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania south to Zimbabwe and Mozambique, it is present on the African wintering grounds from September (Chantler and Boesman 2013).;;Although widespread, the species is thought to be in decline due to the loss of nest sites through building renovation, re-roofing or demolition (Mayer 2008).
B275;Apus_caffer;"This species is found over a wide range of habitats including Mediterranean scrub (Chantler and Boesman 2013). It is found in rural areas, close to woodland adjacent to meadows and fields and generally uses similar habitats to Red-rumped Swallow (Hirundo daurica) (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is loosely colonial or solitary. In Spain it breeds from late May. It typically uses disused Little Swift (Apus affinis) or certain swallow (Hirundo) nests, though niches in rock-faces or buildings are sometimes used. In disused nests, it uses feathers and down adhered with saliva as lining; in rock sites it makes a shallow cup of feathers and vegetable matter agglutinated with saliva. Typically lays one to three eggs (Chantler and Boesman 2013). It feeds on small flying insects (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory; the Spanish population is present from early May to August–October and some birds are recorded into early December, with autumn migration through the Straits of Gibraltar occurring mid-August to mid-October (Chantler and Boesman 2013).";;"The size of the European population renders it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B273;Apus_pallidus;The species is typically associated with coastal sites, especially islets. It is typically found around cliff-faces and gorges, though in many parts of range also in urban areas, where it commonly breeds. It forages over many habitats. In Gibraltar the first clutch is produced from mid-April, peaking late May with second clutches from late July and last fledging mid-October. It lays two to three eggs. It nests in a variety of sites such as caves, cliff faces, niches, eaves, under tiles, holes in palms, and on Gibraltar forcibly vacated fresh nests of House Martins (Delichon urbica). The round nest is made of straw and feathers agglutinated and adhered to substrate with saliva. It feeds on insects and spiders. The species is a medium-distance migrant, wintering in west and central Africa. It is present in France from early April to mid-November, Gibraltar from late February to October and the Canaries from January to September. It migrates through north-west Africa from late February to early May and August/November (Chantler et al. 2014).;;There are currently no known threats to this species.
B272;Apus_unicolor;"The species uses sea cliffs and is never found very far from the sea. It occurs over all habitats in Canaries from sea-level to 2,500 m; especially common in deep coastal gulleys. On Madeira it occurs from sea-level to the highest summit, Pico Ruivo, breeding on rocky islets. It breeds between March and August and lays two eggs. It nests in a variety of natural sites, such as caves and cliffs, where suitable rock niches occur, or under tiles or in holes in man-made structures. The saucer-shaped nest is constructed largely from downy seed cases with other plant matter or man-made items less frequently incorporated, agglutinated with saliva with occasional feathers adhered to surface. It feeds on insects. Numbers are reduced in winter on the Canary Islands; migrants probably winter mainly in north-west Africa, as there are winter records from Mauritania and northern Morocco for the species there (Chantler and Boesman 2014).";;There are currently no known threats to this species.
B270;Apus_melba;The species occurs over a wide range of habitats and forages over vast areas. It is found in temperate and Mediterranean zones, typically in mountains but occasionally in lowlands. It typically breeds below 1,500 m, sometimes to 2,200–2,300 m. It breeds from March to June, laying mid-late May or as late as early June in central Europe, nestlings are seen being fed in the Caucasus in early July. It typically lays three eggs. It uses ledges or holes in cliff-faces or tall man-made structures with the pairs using the same nest-site in successive years. The nest is saucer-shaped, consisting of downy feathers from many species, and swift primaries, tightly bound with dried plant matter and saliva (Chantler et al. 2014). The species is migratory, with West Palearctic populations probably wintering all across the northern tropics of Africa (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;Foraging habitats are lost to human development across its range. In addition, the increasing use of pesticides reduces both the numbers and variety of insects available for it to feed on. (Perrins 2009).
B269;Caprimulgus_europaeus;The species nests on bare or sparsely vegetated ground, often on free-draining soils (Cramp 1985). It uses mainly dry, open country including lowland heaths with scattered trees and bushes, commons and moorland, forest and woodland (especially glades, clearings and edges), recently felled woodland and young forestry plantations. It also uses chalk downland, industrial waste tips, wooded or scrub-covered steppe, sparsely forested or stony hillsides, oak scrubland, dense coppices, shingle, sand dunes, semi-deserts and deserts. It breeds between late May and August. It usually lays one to two eggs. Eggs are laid directly on the ground on leaf litter, pine needles or bare soil. It feeds on flying insects. It hunts over open country in clearings, along woodland edges and borders, in woodland glades and rides, in gardens and orchards, over wetlands, in meadows and farmland, around grazing animals, and over stagnant ponds. The species is highly migratory wintering mainly in south and east Africa, although small numbers may winter in west Africa (Cleere and Christie 2013).;;The main threats to this species are the reduction of insect availability due to pesticide use (Tucker and Heath 1994, Cleere and Christie 2013) and habitat loss or degradation, generally caused through the grazing of heathlands and pastoral woodlands and conversion of such habitats to agricultural land, vineyards, commercial forestry and urban areas. Disturbance from recreational use of heathlands and road deaths may also contribute to its decline (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species has numerous predators, especially of eggs and chicks, including: crows (Corvus), Magpies (Pica pica), Jays (Garrulus glandarius), owls (Strigidae), Sooty Falcon (Falco concolor), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), weasels (Mustela nivalis) and domestic dogs (Cleere and Christie 2013). Nitrogenous pollutants in rain may lead to eutrophication of dry-land breeding areas and unsuitable vegetation structure. Also, climate change may change the geographic range of the species in the future (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B268;Caprimulgus_ruficollis;The species typically uses lowlands and hillsides, with scattered vegetation and bare ground, in pine woodland, coastal forest, eucalyptus or olive plantations, vineyards, open scrubland with cork oak (Quercus suber), prickly pear (Opuntia) or scattered trees, and dense thickets of broom, gorse (Ulex), bramble (Rubus fruticosus), tree heath (Erica arborea) or pistachio (Pistacea lentiscus) (Cleere et al. 2013). In south-west Spain it is attracted towards the warmth of paved roads during migration and during cool weather (temperature below 20°C) or low temperatures (below 14°C), with paved roads providing significantly warmer substrate than gravelled or sandy areas (Camacho 2013). It breeds from early May to late August in Spain and Portugal (Cleere et al. 2013). It usually lays one to two eggs (Cuadrado and Domínguez 1996). The eggs are laid directly on the ground, on leaf litter or pine needles. It feeds on flying and flightless insects. The species is migratory, wintering in west Africa although the exact range is unclear (Cleere et al. 2013).;;In the Algarve region of Spain the species is declining due to habitat loss and disturbance from the tourist industry. More broadly loss of habitat due to urbanization or agriculture probably is the biggest threat. In cultivated areas, nests are often at risk from agricultural activities. The impacts of predation are poorly documented, but in southern Spain eggs and chicks may be taken by lizards (Lacerta lepida), snakes and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Their habit of perching on tarmac in cooler weather makes them vulnerable to collision with vehicles (Cleere et al. 2013).
B239;Alca_torda;"The species lives on rocky sea coasts, breeding on cliff ledges and under boulders. Northern populations migrate outside the breeding season, while southern ones are both migratory as far as the Mediterranean (mainly immatures) and dispersive (adults). Iceland holds over two-thirds of the European total, followed in importance by the U.K. and Norway, these three countries together supporting over 90% of the European population (Tucker and Heath 1994). 

The species is a pursuit diver that propels itself through the water with its wings. They are capable of diving to 120 m depth, but mostly forage nearer the surface. They spend most of their lives at sea, only arriving ashore to reproduce. They are known to consume Krill, Sprat (Sprattus sprattus), Sandeels (Ammondytes spp.) and Capelin amongst other prey (Nettleship 1996).";;"This species is threatened by the current and future impacts of climate change, including temperature extremes, sea temperature rises and shifts and reductions in prey availability (Sandvik et al. 2005). The species is vulnerable to extreme weather, with severe winter storms causing large scale mortality across north-western Europe in the past (Underwood & Stowe 1984). As a pursuit diver the species is at risk from being caught in gillnets and driftnets, with gillnet fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas known to catch significant numbers (Zydelis et al. 2009, 2013; Skov et al. 2011). As the species spends much of its life at sea, including at and below the sea surface, it is vulnerable to both chronic oil pollution and oil spill events. Offshore renewable energy, such as wind farms are also likely to pose a threat to this species, including through habitat displacement (Furness et al. 2013) and collision, although collision risk is currently considered low (Bradbury et al. 2014). Disturbance from shipping lanes and marine constructions occurs in coastal and offshore areas with high human presence, and habitat degradation at sea from mining and aggregate extraction also threatens this species. On land during its breeding season this species is exposed to invasive mammalian predators (e.g. rats, cats, mink), which could increase in severity as climate change allows their northward movement. The species is also vulnerable to disturbance from recreational and tourism activities. It is hunted in the Faroe Islands (Thorup et al. 2014)."
B236;Alle_alle;The species is migratory, expanding its range in winter to include the North Atlantic Ocean as far south as the U.K. This species feeds mainly on small invertebrates such as amphipods and euphausiids and on fish larvae. The precise timing of its spring arrival at breeding colonies is variable from late February to early May. Immense colonies are formed on sea coasts in the high Arctic, usually nesting in crevices in rock scree of maritime slopes and on coastal cliffs. Colonies are abandoned in August with individuals seeking waters in the low Arctic and boreal zones, rarely further south, often associated with the edge of packice (Nettleship et al. 2015).;;This species is threatened by the current and future impacts of climate change, including temperature extremes, sea temperature rises and shifts and reductions in prey availability (Stempniewicz et al. 2007, Hovin et al. 2014). As a pursuit diver the species is at risk from being caught in gillnets and driftnets (Zydelis et al. 2013), with the lumpsucker fisheries in Greenland estimated to catch significant numbers (Merkel et al. 2011). As the species spends much of its life at sea, including at and below the sea surface, it is vulnerable to both chronic oil pollution and oil spill events. Recent tracking research has indicated that important foraging grounds for the species overlap with expanding oil and gas extraction activities and shipping, which could lead to habitat degradation and displacement (Fort et al. 2013). On land during its breeding season this species is exposed to predation from invasive alien predators, which could increase in severity as climate change allows the northward movement of predators.
B240;Cepphus_grylle;The species breeds along cliffs and rocky shores. The species is exclusively marine and is a pursuit diver that propels itself through the water using its wings. The species is probably primarily a benthic forager, since much of the prey consists of benthic fish and invertebrates, including crustaceans (Bradstreet and Brown 1985, Cairns 1987a). Various studies find sandeels (Ammodytes spp.) (Harris and Riddiford 1989, Ewins 1990) and blennies (particularly butterfish Pholis gunnellus) (Harris and Riddiford 1989, Ewins 1990) to be the most important prey species of fish, although the relative contributions of each of these to the overall diet differs. Flatfish (Harris and Riddiford 1989) and gadoids (Ewins 1990) are also sometimes important. Adults tend to consume a higher proportion of invertebrates than the chicks do (Ewins 1990). The few data on winter food suggest that invertebrates are of greater importance during the winter than during the summer (Ewins 1990).;;This species is likely to be susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance. The species is vulnerable to oil spills and other marine pollution (HELCOM 2013, Nettleship et al 2014). At the breeding colonies the species is vulnerable to invasive predators, such as rats, cats, and American Mink (Neovison vison) (HELCOM 2013). The species is susceptible to being caught in gillnets (Fangel et al. 2011, Zydelis et al. 2013), although other fishing gears may also catch significant numbers. Increasing numbers of offshore wind farms may result in displacement from habitat, and a low risk of collision (Bradbury et al. 2014). It is hunted for consumption in parts of Scandinavia (Mendel et al. 2008).
B241;Fratercula_arctica;"The breeding range is restricted to colder parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, with its southernmost colonies in Brittany (France).  Breeding colonies are located in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands, the U.K., Ireland and France on islands or high cliffs.

The species nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea cliffs and rocky slopes (Nettleship et al. 2014). During the winter the species is highly pelagic and is dispersed widely across the sea from the Azores to the western Mediterranean and Canary Islands. When feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). Birds of this species are pursuit-divers that catch most of their prey within 30 m of the water surface (Piatt& Nettleship 1985). They prey on 'forage' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring (Clupea harengus), juvenile and adult capelin (Mallotus villosus), and sand eel (Ammodytes spp.) (Barrett et al. 1987). At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids (Harris and Hislop 1978, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). Sand eels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Harris and Riddiford 1989, Martin 1989), and many chicks starve during periods of low sand eel abundance (Martin 1989).";;This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance (Durant et al. 2003, Sandvik et al. 2005). This is a particularly important threat when prey species are exploited unsustainably, leading to prey reductions and subsequent unsuccessful breeding. The species is vulnerable to oil spills and other marine pollution. The species is also vulnerable to extreme weather events and storms, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea. At the breeding colonies the species is vulnerable to invasive predators, such as rats, cats, and American Mink (Neovison vison). The species is susceptible to being caught in gillnets, although other fishing gears may also catch significant numbers. Increasing numbers of offshore wind farms may result in displacement from habitat, although the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury et al. 2014). The species is hunted for human consumption in Iceland, and in the Faroe Islands (Thorup et al. 2014).
B237;Uria_aalge;"This species is exclusively marine, occurring along sea coasts on rocky cliffs and offshore islands. It breeds mainly on steep sea cliffs and low, flat islands. During the winter it is mostly found offshore, along the edge of continental shelf and shallow banks, marine coasts and bays, usually in boreal waters but some birds occur in the cool subtropical zone. The time of breeding is variable and is largely determined by water temperature and ice. Generally egg-laying takes place mid-May to early June and fledging mostly by late July to mid-August. It lays on a broad or narrow cliff ledge and on low, flat islands; occasionally also in crevices, under boulders and in caves. It does not build a nest and lays a single egg on bare rock. It is a pursuit-diving marine bird which forages primarily during daylight (Wanless et al. 1988). During the breeding season, schooling pelagic fish species are the most important prey for adults, though benthic species can also be important. In Labrador, Canada, Shannies (Sicheaidae) were the main source of food, comprising 84% of the diet in 1996 and 52.9% in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). Capelin (Mallotus villosus) were also important, forming 44.7% of the diet in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). In the U.K., the main prey taxa are sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) and clupeids. Small gadoids are also important at some colonies. The species winters mostly within its breeding range with some birds remaining relatively sedentary (Nettleship et al. 2013).";;"This species is highly vulnerable to human disturbance as it is found in high concentrations outside the breeding season. Throughout the 19th and early 20thcenturies, egg collection and shooting at colonies, as well as introduced alien predators caused severe declines in the world population and unregulated hunting in Greenland is still a major threat.  As human populations increased and expanded the species was extirpated in many regions, particularly in the south of its range.

Other important threats are overfishing of important forage species (e.g. capelin, herring, cod and sandeels) in the North Atlantic (Barents Sea, Iceland), uncontrolled gill-net fisheries in the north-east Atlantic and oil pollution and offshore petroleum developments in areas such as the Barents and North Seas and Greenland (Nettleship et al. 2013). The species is susceptible to avian cholera (Österblom et al. 2004) so is threatened by future outbreaks of this disease. Wind farm development has a negative impact on this species as well (Vanermen et al. 2014). The species is also likely threatened by future climate change (Sandvik 2005, Frederiksen et al. 2013)."
B238;Uria_lomvia;"The species is exclusively marine, occurring offshore and along sea coasts. It breeds on coastal cliffs and islands, and is almost completely restricted to high and low Arctic zones with open water and adequate summer food supply (Nettleship and Christie 2013).breeding only in areas where vigorous vertical circulation creates open water supporting rich planktonic biomass near cliffed coasts (Snow and Perrins 1998). It winters mostly offshore to the edge of the continental shelf, and along sea coasts and in bays where concentrations of fish and invertebrates occur. At sea it is found in flocks which are often large, likely related to the non-random distribution of winter prey. Colony locations are usually associated with dynamic water systems, for example fronts, upwellings and converging currents where primary and secondary productivity is high. Arrival at breeding colonies and start of laying are variable and usually related to sea temperatures; towards the southern limit of low Arctic water and in northern boreal waters laying takes place late May to early June, in more northerly locations laying later in June or July. The species is highly colonial, usually in immense aggregations and at high densities on steep sea cliffs. The single egg is laid directly onto bare rock on narrow cliff ledges. It feeds on fish, squid and crustaceans throughout the year, supplemented by polychaetes and molluscs (Nettleship and Christie 2013). In low-Arctic Greenland and in the European sector of the polar basin, part of the population is present year round though some birds, notably immatures, move away in autumn (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds from west Greenland move south to east Newfoundland (shelf and Grand Banks) and Nova Scotia. Birds from the European Arctic move south-west towards west Greenland, including Spitsbergen birds that reach both south-west Greenland and Newfoundland waters (Nettleship and Christie 2013)."; It avoids extensive permanent pack-ice, ;The species suffers from incidental kills in fishing nets, competition with commercial fisheries, notably in Barents Sea, Iceland and oil pollution and offshore oil developments in many areas (e.g,. Barents Sea, North Sea) (Nettleship and Christie 2013). It is also likely to be affected by climate change (Gaston et al. 2005).
B158;Burhinus_oedicnemus;"The species inhabits lowland heath, semi-natural dry grassland, infertile agricultural grassland, steppe on poor soil, desert and extensive sand-dunes (Tucker and Heath 1994). It breeds on open, bare ground or areas with little vegetation (Batten et al. 1990), and has adapted to arable land but only where crops are short or have an open structure during the breeding season, such as maize, carrots, sugar beet and sunflowers (Green 1988); intensively grown cereals are normally too tall and dense in spring to be used (Tucker and Heath 1994). Communal daytime roosts in autumn and winter in Spain occupy traditional sites which have some cover (e.g. shrubland, gravel pits, vineyards) and include both local birds and winter visitors (Barros 1995). It breeds in spring in most of its range (Hume and Kirwan 2013), with egg-laying from early April to June or early July (Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding occurs between February and June in the Canary Islands and from April in U.K.. The nest is a scrape on the ground, lined with a little grass or unlined, but often with a ring of stones or shells and pieces of vegetation around rim. It usually lays two eggs (Hume and Kirwan 2013). Northern and eastern European populations migrate in autumn to southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (Snow and Perrins 1998, Hume and Kirwan 2013). Populations in Iberia are resident whilst the Canary Islands population remain within the island group, but sometimes move from island to island (Hume and Kirwan 2013).";;"Pressures from habitat loss and disturbance have affected this species, particularly those associated with forestry, agricultural intensification, decline in sheep rearing in places, and human recreational pressure on coasts. Many birds are shot and trapped on migration in Mediterranean region but numbers and effects on populations uncertain; collisions with overhead wires and fences, and predation by foxes also cause numerous losses (Hume and Kirwan 2013)."
B170;Charadrius_alexandrinus;"Although some populations of this species are sedentary or only disperse short distances (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), most inland and northern coastal populations (Hayman et al. 1986) are fully migratory and have distinct separate breeding and wintering ranges (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). The species occupies its breeding grounds chiefly from March to October (Hayman et al. 1986); dispersing from late-June immediately after the young fledge, with the southward migration peaking in September (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). During all seasons the species is predominantly coastal (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and is usually found on sand, silt or dry mud surfaces (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). It also shows a preference for sparsely vegetated and sandy areas when breeding (Johnsgard 1981). Typical habitats include sandy, pebbly or muddy shores (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, Grimmett et al. 1998), dunes (Johnsgard 1981), coastal lagoons (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), estuaries and tidal mudflats (Urban et al. 1986). It is uncommon on freshwater, even when migrating (Hayman et al. 1986), but frequently occurs on inland habitats not far from the coast such as seasonal watercourses (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), open flats near brackish or saline lakes (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Boesman 2013), salt-pans (Grimmett et al. 1998, Wiersma and Boesman 2013), salty steppes with scattered grasses (Johnsgard 1981), sandy deserts (Johnsgard 1981), pebbly or muddy plains (Johnsgard 1981), gravel pits (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), and less frequently sandy riverbanks (Johnsgard 1981, Urban et al. 1986, Grimmett et al. 1998), sandy pond margins (Grimmett et al. 1998) and barren reservoir shores (Johnsgard 1981, Wiersma and Boesman 2013). Its diet consists mainly of insects and their larvae (Johnsgard 1981, Wiersma and Boesman 2013), gammarids (Johnsgard 1981), crabs (Urban et al. 1986), other crustaceans (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and brine shrimps, bivalve and univalve molluscs, polychaete worms (Johnsgard 1981), spiders (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and small pieces of seaweed (Urban et al. 1986).

The nest is a shallow scrape (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) positioned near water on bare earth or in sparse vegetation (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), often on slightly raised ground and partly sheltered by plants (Snow and Perrins 1998) or near conspicuous objects such as grass clumps or shrubs (Johnsgard 1981). The species nests in semicolonial groups, with nests spaced between two and five metres (Snow and Perrins 1998).";, generally avoiding very exposed oceanic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998) and rocky or broken ground (Wiersma and Boesman 2013);The species is threatened by the disturbance of coastal habitats (e.g. tourists trampling nests and disturbing roosts on beaches) (Lafferty et al. 2006). It is also threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitat through environmental pollution (Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006), land reclamation (Barter 2006, Wiersma and Boesman 2013), declining river flows (Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006) (from water abstraction), unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna (Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006), urbanisation (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into coastal areas by rivers (Barter 2006). The species is susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Blaker 1967).
B172;Charadrius_asiaticus;This species breeds in desert and desert steppe near water amongst sparse shrub vegetation (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) up to about 800 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is primarily associated with saline habitats such as saltpans, saline soils subject to seasonal flooding (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), inland saltmarshes (Johnsgard 1981) and alkali flats (Flint et al. 1984). The species concentrates in flocks after breeding ready for migration on the banks of lakes, rivers, water-holes trampled by cattle (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and cultivated land (Hayman et al. 1986). During migration the species has been recorded on damp sandbanks and pebble beds (Hockey et al. 2005). The birds arrive on their breeding grounds from late-March to early-May and egg-laying begins in April. The nest of this species is a shallow scrape, sparsely lined with vegetation and debris, on open ground or amongst low vegetation. Clutch size is three eggs (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). The species is primarily carnivorous throughout both the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Whilst breeding the species takes mainly adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1981, Wiersma and Boesman 2013), although it will occasionally take plant material. During the non-breeding season beetles, termites, grasshoppers and small snails are the main contributors to this species's diet, and it is often observed hunting for insects in town refuse heaps and cattle dung. This species is fully migratory. It winters in Africa between August and October (Wiersma and Boesman 2013).;;The main threat to this species is the destruction of natural steppe and grassland though overgrazing and conversion to intensive agricultural practices, especially within the European (breeding) part of its range (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). The European population is on the edge of its world range, conditions may well be suboptimal for the species within the region, making it particularly vulnerable to habitat change (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B169;Charadrius_dubius;This species is fully migratory in much of its range. The European population migrates across the Sahara Desert between late-July and early September (leaving breeding grounds June to mid-July) to reach wintering grounds in tropical Africa from late-August onwards. These populations return to their breeding grounds from mid-March, where they breed April-June (Europe) (Wiersma et al. 2013). This species is mainly solitary throughout the non-breeding season and on migration, occasionally occurring in flocks of not more than 10 individuals (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013). It also breeds singly or in loose neighbourhood groups spaced 7–200 m apart (Wiersma et al. 2013). During the breeding season this species shows a preference for bare or sparsely vegetated sandy and pebbly shores of shallow standing freshwater pools, lakes or slow-flowing rivers (Johnsgard, 1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Grimmett et al. 1998, Wiersma et al. 2013), including river islands, dry, stony riverbeds, sand and shingle or silt flats (Johnsgard 1981, Wiersma et al. 2013).  The species prefers lowland habitats . The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting mainly of insects such as beetles, flies (especially larvae and pupae), ants, bugs, mayfly and dragonfly larvae, caddisflies, crickets and larval Lepidoptera, as well as spiders, freshwater shrimps and other small crustaceans, mussels, worms and snails (Johnsgard, 1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013). Vegetation (such as the seeds of grasses, sedges, Polygonum and Compositae) is taken rarely and is likely to be ingested incidentally along with animal matter (Cramp and Simmons 1983). The nest is a shallow scrape on loose sand, dry mud or on flat, bare rocks surrounded by mud or sand (Johnsgard, 1981, Urban et al. 1986), sometimes amongst sparse vegetation (Grimmett et al. 1998, Wiersma et al. 2013) in the vicinity of water, and often on small islands (Wiersma et al. 2013) or adjacent farmland (Hayman et al. 1986). Nesting pairs have also been recorded on flat gravelled roofs (Cramp and Simmons 1983).;This species may also utilise temporary artificial habitats such as gravel pits (Ratcliffe 1974, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma et al. 2013), sewage works, industrial wastelands (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma et al. 2013) and refuse tips (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986), and may use open arable land on clay soil in exceptional circumstances (Johnsgard, 1981)....and is rarely found above 800 m in Europe (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma et al. 2013);This species is threatened primarily by the degradation and loss of its preferred habitats (Barter 2002, Wiersma et al. 2013). Many of the species's breeding sites are also disturbed by human recreational activities (Wiersma et al. 2013). Increased flood regulation and pollution from oil and tar along the Mediterranean coast has resulted in the degradation of the breeding sites in those areas (Wiersma et al. 2013). The species may also be susceptible to outbreaks of avian botulism (Hubalek et al. 2005).
B168;Charadrius_hiaticula;The majority of this species is fully migratory (Hockey et al. 2005, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and travels either on a broad or narrow front depending on the location of each population's breeding and wintering grounds. The species starts to breed from April until June, nesting in solitary pairs or loose semi-colonial groups (especially in undisturbed areas) (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). It is a gregarious species (Hayman et al. 1986) and often roosts communally in flocks of several hundred close to its feeding areas (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Boesman 2013), occurring singly, in small (up to 50 individuals) or large flocks (up to 1,200–1,500 individuals) during the non-breeding season (Urban et al. 1986). The species breeds primarily on sand or shingle beaches either along the Arctic coast (Hayman et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) or around coastal tundra pools or lakes (Johnsgard 1981). In the south of its range it may also breed inland on the Arctic tundra (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) on muddy plains with stones or pebbles (Johnsgard 1981), on shores and sandbars of inland rivers, lakes, gravel pits or reservoirs (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Boesman 2013, Snow and Perrins 1998), or on short grassland, farmland (Snow and Perrins 1998, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and other well-drained sites (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits muddy, sandy or pebbly coasts in the tropics and subtropics (Johnsgard 1981) including estuaries (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), tidal mudflats and sandflats. It also frequents mudbanks or sandbanks along rivers and lakes (Urban et al. 1986), lagoons, saltmarshes, short grassland, farmland, flooded fields, gravel pits, reservoirs (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), sewage works and saltpans during this season (Hockey et al. 2005). Its diet consists of small crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms, isopods, amphipods, insects (e.g., ants, beetles, flies and fly larvae) and millipedes. The nest is a shallow scrape (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) positioned near the high-water mark on shingle or sandy beaches (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986). The species is a solitary nester although it may breed at quite high densities in undisturbed areas, neighbouring nests spaced between 5 and 100 m apart (Wiersma and Boesman 2013).;;Important migratory stop-over habitats for this species on the Baltic Sea coastline are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, land abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub overgrowth (Grishanov et al. 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian botulism (so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease) (Blaker 1967), and suffers predation from feral American Mink (Neovison vison) in some regions (Nordstrom et al. 2003).
B171;Charadrius_leschenaultii;During the breeding season this species is predominantly found in open, dry, treeless, uncultivated areas up to 1,000 m (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Wiersma and Bonan 2013), including dried mud, silt and clay flats, hard salt-pans overgrown with halophytic plants (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), and rocky plains near mountains in desert or semi-desert (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, Wiersma and Bonan 2013). In Turkey the species frequents heavily grazed saline steppe. The species usually breeds near water (Wiersma and Bonan 2013). During the non-breeding season this species shows a preference for littoral habitats (Urban et al. 1986) with mixed sand and mud substrata (Hockey et al. 2005). It is generally found on sheltered sandy, shelly or muddy beaches, large intertidal mudflats, sandbanks, salt-marshes, estuaries, rocky islands (Wiersma and Bonan 2013), tidal lagoons (Hockey et al. 2005) and dunes near the coast (Urban et al. 1986). Whilst on migration the species will occasionally utilise inland habitats such as salt-lakes and brackish swamps, usually roosting on sandbanks and spits (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Bonan 2013). In Turkey, egg-laying occurs from late April to late May and in Armenia unfledged chicks have been recorded in late June. It is a solitary breeder. The nest is a shallow scrape in the ground, variably lined with plant fragments and situated in the open or among low vegetation. Clutch size is usually three eggs (Wiersma and Bonan 2013). This species is carnivorous: during the breeding season its diet consists mainly of terrestrial insects and their larvae (especially beetles, termites, midges and ants), and occasionally lizards. In the non-breeding season its diet contains mainly marine invertebrates such as molluscs (snails), worms and crustaceans (Johnsgard 1981). This species is fully migratory, wintering on the shores of Australasia and the Indian Ocean, but relation between breeding and non-breeding quarters poorly known. It is probable it migrates without stopping on a broad front between breeding and non-breeding areas (Wiersma and Bonan 2013).;;In some parts of its breeding range this species is threatened by the destruction of wetlands and bordering fallow steppe through drainage and water extraction for irrigation (Turkey) (Snow and Perrins 1998, Wiersma and Bonan 2013). Favoured migration staging posts, such as the Çukurova delta in southern Turkey are under increasing pressure from hunting, tourism and industrial activities and are often polluted along the coast with oil (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B173;Charadrius_morinellus;"This species breeds on flat open uplands, on mountain ridges and plateaux with sparse vegetation, and on coastal and inland Arctic tundra of moss, short grass or lichen and bare patches of rock (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Kirwan 2013). On passage the species stages in exposed areas with short vegetation, such as heathlands and fallow or ploughed fields, and during the winter its habitats include stony and shrubby steppe, semi-desert, ploughed farmland and the margins of cultivation. Its wintering grounds are less well known, but include stony steppe, ploughed farmlands, semi-desert, including marginal cultivation and shrubby steppe (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013). The species breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary well-dispersed pairs (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Kirwan 2013).

The nest is a shallow scrape on bare ground or in short vegetation. The species is a solitary nester but where suitable habitat is restricted it may also breed in loose groups of two to five. Its diet consists of insects (e.g. beetles, adult and larval Diptera, larval Lepidoptera, grasshoppers, crickets, earwigs and ants), spiders, snails and earthworms, as well as plant matter such as leaves, seeds, berries and flowers. This species is fully migratory and travels non-stop on a broad front across Europe, staging first at a number of traditional sites (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013).";;"Predicted climate change now presents a potentially catastrophic threat to the species, as this and many other boreal land birds are wholly dependent on the ecological conditions currently prevailing in northern Eurasia. Cause for recent declines in Europe might be heavy persecution in North Africa; amelioration of climate in breeding area may also be significant factor.  Species has appeared incapable of truly colonizing northern England as a breeding bird, despite availability of seemingly suitable habitat, presumably due to number of sheep, degree of recreational use and increasing acidification of soils. Wintering populations poorly known. Numbers declined in Britain in late 19th century due to hunting and egg-collecting (Wiersma and Kirwan 2013)."
B166;Pluvialis_apricaria;"This species is fully migratory but may only move short distances in some regions (Wiersma et al. 2013). It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013), adults leaving the breeding grounds before the juveniles between July and August. The return migration in the spring peaks between April and early-May (Hayman et al. 1986). The species breeds on humid moss, lichen and hummock tundra (Wiersma et al. 2013), low-lying marshes in moss tundra (Johnsgard 1981), shrub tundra, open bogs in forest, peatlands, alpine tundra (Wiersma et al. 2013), highland bogs, moors (Johnsgard 1981), and swampy highland heaths with high abundances of sphagnum moss and heather (Johnsgard 1981, Wiersma et al. 2013). It shows a preference for nesting on short vegetation less than 15 cm tall (Ratcliffe 1977). When on passage and in its winter quarters (Wiersma et al. 2013) the species frequents freshwater wetlands, moist grasslands (Urban et al. 1986), pastures (Wiersma et al. 2013), agricultural land (e.g. stubble, ploughed or fallow fields) (Urban et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013) and highland steppe (Urban et al. 1986), also foraging on tidal shores, coastal rocky outcrops (Johnsgard 1981), intertidal flats (Wiersma et al. 2013) and saltmarshes (Urban et al. 1986, Wiersma et al. 2013) in shallow bays and estuaries (Wiersma et al. 2013). Its diet consists predominantly of insects (especially the adults, pupae and larvae of beetles (Wiersma et al. 2013), larval Lepidoptera, locusts and grasshoppers (Urban et al. 1986)), as well as earthworms, spiders, millipedes, snails, polycheate worms (Wiersma et al. 2013), crustaceans (Johnsgard 1981) and some plant material (e.g. berries, seeds and grass).

The nest is a shallow scrape on bare ground in flat, sparse areas with short vegetation (less than 15 cm). The species is a solitary nester, although in optimal habitats neighbouring pairs may nest only a few hundred metres apart (Wiersma et al. 2013).";;The species has suffered minor range contractions due to the cultivation and afforestation of heathlands (Ratcliffe 1977, Wiersma et al. 2013), and is susceptible to very cold winter temperatures and severe weather conditions (Ratcliffe 1977). The species is frequently taken by hunters on its wintering grounds (e.g. France) (Wiersma et al. 2013).
B167;Pluvialis_squatarola;This species is fully migratory (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). It departs its breeding grounds from late July to September (southward movements continuing into November) (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and returns from late May to June (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary well-dispersed pairs (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and forages alone or in small loose flocks (Johnsgard 1981) of up to 30 individuals. It is gregarious during the winter however, often roosting in large flocks containing up to several thousand individuals. The species nests in the high Arctic in both upland and valley locations (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) between the treeline and the coast (Snow and Perrins 1998), utilising dry stony tundra with sedge, moss, lichen (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), grass (Johnsgard 1981) or dwarf birch (Snow and Perrins 1998), peat ridges in tundra marshes, dry exposed ridges, riverbanks, raised sand or gravel beaches, and rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season the species frequents intertidal mudflats, saltmarshes (Wiersma and Boesman 2013), sandflats (Johnsgard 1981, Wiersma and Boesman 2013) and beaches (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) of oceanic coastlines, bays and estuaries (Johnsgard 1981). During migration it may also be found inland on lakes, pools or grasslands. During the breeding season the diet of this species consists largely of adult and larval insects such as beetles and Diptera as well as some plant matter (e.g. grass seeds and stems). When on the coast in its wintering range the species takes marine polychaete worms, molluscs and crustaceans (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) (e.g. crabs, sand shrimps) (Johnsgard 1981), occasionally also taking insects (e.g. grasshoppers and beetles) or earthworms when in inland habitats on passage (Wiersma and Boesman 2013). The nest is a shallow scrape (Wiersma and Boesman 2013) on dry ground in exposed, stony sites (Snow and Perrins 1998), neighbouring nests not less than 400 m apart (Wiersma and Boesman 2013).;;Populations fluctuate from year year to year with poor weather and predator pressure in years of low lemming numbers (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Warmer temperatures brought about by climate change are thought to affect this species (Maclean et al. 2008). It is also threatened by disturbance from recreational activities (Cutts et al. 2009), intertidal oyster culture (Gittings and O'Donoghue 2012) and urban and industrial development.
B514;Vanellus_gregarius;This species breeds mainly in the transition zones of Stipa and Artemisia grassland steppes and on dry wasteland, cultivated, ploughed and stubble fields. During migration, it is found mainly on sandy plains with short grass, dry meadows, fallow land and cultivated fields. Breeding begins from mid-April until July in semi-colonial groups of 3–20 pairs. The nest consists of a scrape that can be unlined or lined with plant material, pebbles and debris in which a clutch of two to five eggs are laid (Wiersma et al. 2015). It feeds mainly on insects and moth larvae as well as arachnids and frequently small amounts of plant matter including grains, leaves and flowers (Wiersma et al. 2015). Migration begins August to September usually in small flocks of 15–20 birds. It disperses south through Asia and Africa with a small number wintering in south-west Iberia (Wiersma et al. 2015).;;Key factors explaining the magnitude of declines remain poorly understood, despite much recent research. On the breeding grounds it was probably formerly threatened by the conversion of steppe to arable cultivation, plus, perhaps less likely, the reduction in grazing by large herds of native ungulates and latterly by the loss of the enormous herds of domestic grazing animals from state-sponsored collective farms (Eichhorn and Khrokov 2002, Watson et al. 2006). However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, large areas of arable cultivation have been abandoned and are reverting to natural steppe habitat, herds of domestic livestock have become concentrated around villages (where their permanent presence leads to shorter swards than were created by the vast herds that grazed semi-nomadically under the Soviet system), while an increase in fires (owing to reduced control of fires) may also have contributed to an increase in suitable habitat. In parts of Kazakhstan, these factors are thought to be behind the possible increase in numbers in recent years and this may be the case elsewhere too (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Concentration of nests in heavily grazed areas in the vicinity of villages may have increased threats from human disturbance and trampling by sheep, goats and possibly other livestock (Watson et al. 2006, M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007). Low egg survival due to nesting in areas of high grazer density has been suggested as one of the causes for the species's decline (Watson et al. 2006). The species may be affected by the increasingly dry climate in its breeding and wintering range, but it is not clear if this benefits or threatens this semi-desert species (Watson et al. 2006). Illegal hunting during migration and on the wintering grounds may now be the primary threat (M. A. Koshkin, J. Kamp and R. D. Sheldon in litt. 2007, Biricik et al. 2008). Data from 2005–2012 suggest that low adult survival, perhaps resulting from known hunting pressure along the migration routes, appears to be the most critical demographic rate (Sheldon et al. 2013).
B163;Vanellus_indicus;This species is found from lowlands up to c. 1,800 m in open areas near fresh or brackish water: rivers, mudbanks, wet grassland, pools, particularly on cultivated land, such as corn fields, grass fields and large gardens. It also uses open forests, waste, fallow and ploughed land and occasionally grass along highways (Wiersma & de Juana 2014). Birds from the Turkish population have been recorded using dam lakes, farmland and riverine gravel islands. No data on breeding period in Turkey but adults have been observed with chicks in May and June (Kirwan et al. 2008). The nest is a shallow scrape, unlined or lined with small stones and debris, usually situated near water. Clutch size three to four eggs. The species feeds on beetles and other insects as well as molluscs, worms and crustaceans. No information for the Turkish population but within its global range it is resident, dispersive and in places migratory and in winter, generally moves down from high altitudes (Wiersma & de Juana 2014).;;The species is not known to be facing any major threats however the European population is on the edge of the species global range and thus is particularly vulnerable to any threats.
B165;Vanellus_leucurus;This species is fully migratory (Wiersma 1996). Migratory populations breed in Russia between mid-April to May and depart on a broad front for winter quarters in north-east Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan and northern India (Hayman et al. 1986) between mid-July and September (Wiersma 1996), although individuals occasionally winter in Russia, returning to breeding grounds during March and April (Hayman, et al. 1986). This species often breeds in loose colonies of between 4 and 24 pairs (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma 1996). Outside of the breeding season this species occurs singly, in pairs or small groups (Urban et al. 1986), with small migratory flocks of between 1-6 individuals and wintering flocks of 6-25 individuals (del Hoyo, et al. 1996). This species is diurnal (Wiersma 1996). The species shows a preference for habitats in the vicinity of shallow standing or slow-flowing water with suitable smooth beds permitting unhampered walking and wading (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma 1996). In Russia this species breeds in damp, vegetated areas near salt or fresh water, and on small vegetated islets or swampy shores of brackish lakes (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Wiersma 1996). During the winter this species prefers rivers, drainage ditches, ponds, coastal lagoons, marshes (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban, et al. 1986) and flooded or recently dried out grassland (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It also occurs on salt-shrub terrain with low, sparse vegetation, on shallow seepage pools by canals and reservoirs, and on irrigated rice fields (Cramp and Simmons 1983). During this season the species also occurs on dry ground near water such as river banks and lake shores (Urban et al. 1986, Wiersma 1996). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting mainly of insects (especially beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, fly larvae (Wiersma 1996) and locusts (Johnsgard 1981)), but also worms, molluscs and crustaceans (including freshwater shrimps). The nests of this species are shallow scrapes in the open, usually near water (Wiersma 1996). Few observations of nesting sites are available, but one was found on an irrigated but uncultivated field covered with grass, another was observed on a dry ridge near a marsh (Johnsgard 1981).;, but avoids dry, open country (Urban et al. 1986);"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B162;Vanellus_spinosus;This species frequents dry ground (Wiersma and Kirwan 2012) close to fresh or saline (Hayman et al. 1986) pools, lakes, rivers, lagoons (Wiersma and Kirwan 2012) or marshes, as well as burnt grassland, cultivated, flooded or irrigated fields (Hayman et al. 1986, Wiersma and Kirwan 2012), saltflats by alkaline lakes (Urban et al. 1986), mudflats, sandflats, beaches, dunes (Wiersma and Kirwan 2012) and coastal saltpans (Hayman et al. 1986). The species nests from March to September in the eastern Mediterranean region (Hayman et al. 1986), in solitary pairs or loose colonies. The nest is placed in a shallow natural depression in rock lined with pebbles or is a shallow scrape on dry bare ground, either unlined or lined with grass or other plant material and debris, or with a rim of earth, small shells or stones. Also nests on mud. Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, grasshoppers, Diptera, midges, termites and ants) as well as spiders and occasionally crustaceans, molluscs, small lizards, tadpoles, adult frogs, fish and seeds. Breeders in the eastern Mediterranean region are fully migratory and disperse south to Africa for the winter (Wiersma and Kirwan 2012).;;The species has suffered from past declines as a result of the loss of natural and semi-natural saltmarsh habitats. The species is locally exposed to hunting pressures (Wiersma and Kirwan 2012).
B161;Vanellus_vanellus;The species shows a preference for breeding on wet natural grasslands (Trolliet 2003), meadows and hay meadows (Wiersma 1996) at low altitudes, with short swards (Hayman et al. 1986) and patches of bare soil (Johnsgard 1981). It will also breed on grassy moors, swampy heaths, bogs (Johnsgard 1981) and arable fields. During the winter the species utilises large open pastures and arable fields for roosting and forages on stubble, ploughed fields (Wiersma 1996). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs (Wiersma 1996) although pairs may also nest close together in optimal habitat (Johnsgard 1981). Males perform a dazzling aerial song flight display, during which the wingtips produce a droning sound. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with some plant material in short grassy vegetation. Clutch size is typically four eggs but may be only two or three. Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, ants, Diptera, crickets (Wiersma 1996), grasshoppers, dragonflies, mayflies, cicadas and Lepidoptera) (Urban et al. 1986), spiders, snails and earthworms (Wiersma 1996). Most populations of this species are fully migratory (Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and travel on a broad front out of Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998) although some breeding populations in more temperate regions are sedentary (Wiersma 1996).;;This species suffered past declines as a result of land-use intensification and this is still a problem. Wetland drainage and egg collecting have previously threatened the species too (Wiersma 1996). Today it is threatened by reduced breeding productivity as a result of intensifying and changing agricultural practices (Schekkerman et al. 2009), especially the improvement of grasslands (e.g. by drainage, inorganic fertilising and reseeding) (Baldi et al. 2005) and loss of field margins and semi-natural habitat. Important migratory stop-over habitats for this species on the Baltic Sea coastline are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, land abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). Clutch destruction may also occur during spring cultivation (using machinery) on arable fields (Wiersma 1996). The species is susceptible to avian botulism so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Hubalek et al. 2005), and suffers from nest predation from corvids and mammalian predators including introduced mammals on some islands (Jackson 2001) and an increasing number of predators in formerly open and predator-hostile agricultural landscapes (Schekkerman et al. 2009). The species is hunted in France, Greece, Italy and Spain (Trolliet 2003).
B516;Cursorius_cursor;"The species lives in semi-desert, sandy-rocky plains and sand-dunes, preferring areas with a sparse cover of herbaceous vegetation or low shrubs (Tucker and Heath 1994). Typically these habitats are dominated by Frankenia spp., Salsola vermiculata, Launaea arborescens and Lycium intricatum, together with Atriplex glauca, Aizoon canariense and annual grasses (Tucker and Heath 1994). On Tenerife during the winter it occurs on sandy plains with a sparse vegetation cover of Frankenia laevis, Polycarpaea nivea, Heliotropium ramossisimum and Launaea arborescens; occasionally it has also been observed in fields of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum and M. nodiflorum (Tucker and Heath 1994). First eggs laid early February but mostly March to early April in the Canary Islands (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a shallow unlined scrape on bare ground (MacLean 1996). Clutch size usually two eggs (MacLean 1996). It feeds mostly on adult and larval insects but also takes molluscs, isopods, arachnids and seeds (MacLean 1996). Its movements in the Canary Islands are poorly known (Martín and Lorenzo 2001 in Madroño et al. 2004). There may be two populations on Lanzarote, one resident the other migratory (Concepción 2000b in Madroño et al. 2004). The nominate race (Canary Islands population part of this race) makes extensive movements with much of the northern population crossing the Sahara for winter (MacLean 1996). However birds are present on Tenerife during the winter (Tucker and Heath 1994). Birds from the bogulubovi race (including Turkish population) are mainly winter visitors to Pakistan and north-west India (MacLean 1996).";;In the past, heavy egg-collecting pressure contributed to the species' rarity on the Canary Islands. Now the main threats are the destruction and alteration of habitat through development of tourist resorts and the building of new roads (Maclean 1996). In addition overgrazing may cause a problem through soil loss and desertification. Disturbance has increased as a result of an increase in off-road tourist vehicles and military manoeuvres (Gonzalez 1999). There is a need for site protection and this would also benefit the endemic race of Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae) (Maclean 1996). Other potential threats include collision with powerlines, introduced mammals and illegal hunting (Gonzalez 1999).
B160;Glareola_nordmanni;This species breeds on grazed short-grass steppe, fallow and ploughed fields as well as on alkaline flats, sandpits, shell ridges and sparsely vegetated Solonchaks (saltpans) in lake depressions and river valleys (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986, Belik and Lebedeva 2004, Hockey et al. 2005). Large colonies always occur near water and damp meadows, or marshes overgrown with dense grass (Cramp and Simmons 1983). Non-breeding birds frequent open, high-altitude glassland and mudflats. It nests in small to large colonies (5 to 500 pairs, occasionally thousands) from May to July (Maclean 1996). This species nests on open ground, usually near water. The nest consists of a shallow depression of about 10 cm diameter lined with small pieces of vegetation (Cramp and Simmons 1983). Clutches are three to four eggs which are incubated by both sexes (Maclean 1996). It feeds on epigeic and airborne insects, particularly swarming species (Hockey et al. 2005). It takes locusts, orthopterans and coleopterans as well as wasps, bees, dragonflies, ants, termites, flies, ichneumons and cockroaches (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Maclean 1996, Hockey et al. 2005). It forages on the wing and responds quickly to insect emergence after storms (Maclean 1996, Hockey et al. 2005). Migration is overland at high altitude and occurs September to October and April to May (Maclean 1996).;;Threats are poorly understood. Where declines are occurring the key factors probably relate to changing land-use practices such as conversion of steppe to arable agriculture in some areas, shifts in arable land versus livestock grazing on semi-natural steppe in others, and agricultural operations, such as harrowing. Declines occurring from the end of the 19th century in Ukraine and European Russia have been associated with the increase in ploughed areas and the loss of grazed steppe (Kamp et al. 2009). In some areas, predation by corvids may affect breeding success. Whether regional climate change, affects the species negatively or positively, is largely unknown (A. O Solomatin pers. comm.) but it is likely to influence distribution and abundance.
B159;Glareola_pratincola;Northern populations of this species are fully migratory (Hayman et al. 1986, Maclean and Kirwan 2013). The species nests colonially in small groups of 10–20 or up to 100 pairs (Maclean and Kirwan 2013) and is highly gregarious throughout the year. The species breeds on flat open areas (Maclean and Kirwan 2013) with short or patchy vegetation (Hayman et al. 1986) such as fields, steppe plains near water (Maclean and Kirwan 2013) the margins of alkaline lakes and dried mudflats (Hayman et al. 1986) in Eurasia (Maclean and Kirwan 2013). Its diet consists of large insects (e.g. Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Isoptera), spiders and molluscs (Maclean and Kirwan 2013). The nest is a shallow scrape or depression on the ground on dry mudflats and sandflats (Maclean and Kirwan 2013).;;The species is threatened by the use of herbicides and insecticides, and by changes to its preferred habitats (e.g., changes in water levels, ploughing of grasslands, artificial irrigation and fertilisation, changes in traditional grazing regimes, increasing urban encroachment and human disturbance) (Maclean and Kirwan 2013).
B155;Haematopus_ostralegus;Most populations of this species are fully migratory, inland breeders moving to the coast for the winter (Hockey et al. 2013). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs or small groups (Flint et al. 1984), during the winter foraging singly or in small groups of up to 10 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998) and with larger flocks often forming in major bays and estuaries and at roosting sites (Hayman et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998, Hockey et al. 2013). The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, sand and shingle beaches (Hockey et al. 2013), dunes, cliff-tops with short grass (Hayman et al. 1986) and occasionally rocky shores (Hockey et al. 2013), as well as inland along the shores of lakes, reservoirs and rivers (Hayman et al. 1986) or on agricultural (Hockey et al. 2013) grass and cereal fields, often some distance from water (Hayman et al. 1986). Outside of the breeding season the species is chiefly coastal, frequenting estuarine mudflats, saltmarshes and sandy and rocky shores (Hockey et al. 2013). When foraging on soft intertidal substrates bivalves and gastropods are the most important food items for this species (Hockey et al. 2013). Polychaetes and crustaceans are more important in estuaries however, and molluscs (e.g. mussels, limpets and whelks) are most important on rocky shores. When inland, prey such as earthworms and insect larvae (e.g. caterpillars and cranefly larvae) are also taken. The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground (Hockey et al. 2013) often on raised surfaces (e.g. earth banks) (Hayman et al. 1986) in the open or in short vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) on cultivated or uncultivated land, cliff-tops, rocky outcrops or clearings in taller vegetation including woods and moorland (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The main threat to the species is the over-fishing of benthic shellfish and the resulting disappearance of intertidal mussel and cockle beds (Atkinson et al. 2003, Verhulst et al. 2004, Ens 2006). The species is also threatened by habitat degradation on its wintering grounds due to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006) (e.g. from construction work) (Burton et al. 2002), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006) and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B233;Chlidonias_hybrida;"This species utilises a variety of wetland habitats but shows a preference for freshwater marshlands with scattered pools, particularly where the surrounding vegetation is grazed by cattle or horses (Richards 1990). It frequents inland lakes, rivers, marshes, artificial fish-ponds and drainage-ponds covered with water-lilies (e.g. in Italy) (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), swamps, river pools, reservoirs, large dams, sewage-ponds, flooded saltmarshes (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996) and rice-fields. The species breeds from May to early-June (Richards 1990) in monospecific colonies of 10–100 pairs.

The nest is a heap of aquatic vegetation or dry grass, placed either on floating and emergent vegetation over water 60–80 cm deep or resting on the bottom of very shallow water. Clutches are two or three eggs. Its diet consists of terrestrial and aquatic insects (e.g. Dytiscidae, adult and larval Odonata, Orthoptera, flying ants (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) and mosquitoes (Richards 1990)), spiders, frogs, tadpoles, small crabs (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), shrimps (Richards 1990) and small fish. Northern breeding populations of this species are fully migratory (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). After breeding it departs for the wintering grounds from late-July to September, returning again between April and May (Richards 1990). The species sometimes forages singly, but is more common in small groups or larger mixed-species flocks on passage and in the winter (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;This species suffers from the loss of natural wetlands to land reclamation, dry seasons and an increase in drainage schemes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), as well as the canalization of rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species suffers nest destruction from the invasive rodent species Myocastor coypus in Italy (Arduin 1997). Increasing tourism and water sports near breeding colonies result in disturbance and the loss of nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and many nests are lost to adverse weather. Fishermen collect eggs in Ukraine (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). It is affected by water quality and so pollution from insecticides and eutrophication are a threat (Martí and Moral 2004). In addition the intensification of fisheries and bycatch in fishing nets are issues (Golemansky 2011).
B234;Chlidonias_leucopterus;"The species breeds inland on freshwater lakes (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), swampy standing water, rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow naturally flooded grassland (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998) with areas of open water bordered by stands of reeds, sedge and other aquatic vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from April to August in small colonies of between 3 and 100 pairs (mostly 20–40 pairs) that may contain other species.

The nest is a shallow cup in a mound of aquatic vegetation usually placed over water 30–120 cm deep on floating mats of vegetation, or on dry shores or resting on the bottom in shallow water. Clutches are two or three eggs. The species nests in single- or mixed-species colonies, neighbouring nests usually widely spaced (10–30 m apart) but may be as close as 2.5 m. Its diet consists predominantly of aquatic insects (especially Diptera, Odonata and Coleoptera) as well as adult and larval terrestrial insects, small fish and tadpoles. This species is strongly migratory (Gochfeld et al. 2013). Throughout the year the species feeds in flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998) and migrates and overwinters in large flocks (Gochfeld et al. 2013) of up to tens of thousands of individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998).";It generally avoids fish-ponds, rice-fields and ornamental waters (Richards 1990) but may feed over wet fields, dry farmland and steppe grassland. ;The main threats to this species are habitat destruction and water regulation in wetlands.  In the west of its range the reclamation of wetlands is causing declines and in Russia and the Ukraine dry breeding seasons and an increasing number of drainage schemes pose a threat (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In Poland it is threatened by recreational activities causing disturbance (Górski 2004). It is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B235;Chlidonias_niger;The species breeds on fresh or brackish wetlands (Richards 1990) such as small pools, lakes, marshes (Richards 1990, Gochfeld and Burger 1996), ditches, overgrown canals, quiet reaches of rivers, swampy meadows (Richards 1990), peat bogs and rice-fields, showing a preference for well-vegetated areas with sparse, open emergent vegetation (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) (e.g. Typha spp., sedge or reeds) (Flint et al. 1984) and floating water-lilies. It breeds between May and June in colonies, usually of less than 20 pairs (rarely more than 100 pairs) (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) and often close to other species (Flint et al. 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest may be a low compressed mound of plant matter (Flint et al. 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998) placed in very shallow water (Snow and Perrins 1998) or on a floating mat of aquatic vegetation (Flint et al. 1984) over water more than 50 cm deep (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). The nest may also be a shallow scrape (Snow and Perrins 1998) on the ground amongst marsh vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds in small colonies and may forage up to two to five kilometres from breeding sites. Clutches are two or three eggs. During the breeding season, the diet consists predominantly of insects (e.g. chironomids, Odonata, Ephemeroptera and Coleoptera) as well as small fish (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) and amphibians (Snow and Perrins 1998) (e.g. tadpoles and frogs). This species is strongly migratory (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) and travels both over land and over sea (Snow and Perrins 1998). After breeding, it departs for its wintering grounds from July onwards (Richards 1990), returning north again from late-March (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998), foraging in small groups during the breeding season and congregating in large flocks offshore on passage and in the winter over shoals of predatory fish (Richards 1990, Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).;It generally avoids small marshland areas less than 4 ha in area. ;"On its breeding grounds the species is threatened by reductions in food availability due to the eutrophication of surface waters (which reduces the diversity of large insects), the acidification of lakes (which leads to the death of fish) (Beintema 1997) and pesticide pollution (which may also lead to direct mortality from poisoning) (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). 

When breeding the species is also threatened by fluctuating water levels (Snow and Perrins 1998), the loss and deterioration of freshwater nesting habitats (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, van der Winden 2005), e.g. through drainage for agriculture (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and overgrowth ofTypha spp. beds (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Linz and Blixt 1997), and human disturbance (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, van der Winden 2005), especially where this forces breeding pairs to leave the nest before the young are fully fledged (van der Winden 2002).

Nests may be lost through storms and wave action (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). The intensification of fish farming has resulted on encroachment on water bodies, which has reduced the extent of floating vegetation and it suffers competition from other species (e.g. gulls, ducks or swans) which may be exacerbated by other threats (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006)."
B224;Gelochelidon_nilotica;"It breeds in a variety of locations with bare or sparsely vegetated islands, banks, flats, or spits of dry mud and sand (Higgins and Davies 1996) including barrier beaches (shoals), dunes, saltmarshes, saltpans, freshwater lagoons (Gochfield and Burger 1996), estuaries, deltas, inland lakes, rivers and marshes (Snow and Perrins 1998). During this season it may also feed on emerging insects over lakes, agricultural fields, grasslands and even over semi-desert regions (Gochfield and Burger 1996). On passage the species typically forages over saltpans, coastal lagoons, mudflats, marshes and wet fields, overwintering on estuaries, saltpans (Gochfield and Burger 1996), lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998) and saltmarshes (Higgins and Davies 1996) or in more inland sites such as large rivers, lakes (Snow and Perrins 1998), sewage ponds, reservoirs, saltpans and irrigation canals (Higgins and Davies 1996). The species is loosely colonial; usually 5–50 pairs found together. It will often nest in the colonies of other terns or Larus ridibundus. Egg-laying occurs in May and June. The nest is a scrape in dry mud, sand or gravel (Richards 1990) on beaches, dry mudflats, dykes, sea-wrack on the tideline or on floating vegetation (Gochfield and Burger 1996). It is an opportunistic feeder and is largely insectivorous taking adult and larval terrestrial and aquatic insects (Richards 1990, Gochfield and Burger 1996) as well as spiders, earthworms, small reptiles, frogs, small fish (6–9 cm long), aquatic invertebrates and rarely voles and small birds. Northern breeding populations of this species are migratory and European birds disperse in all directions after breeding, then migrate across to Spain, Italy and northern Africa to western Africa, the Rift Valley and coastal eastern Africa; others travel east to India, and occasionally Indonesia (Gochfield and Burger 1996).";;The species is threatened by the deterioration and loss of habitat, e.g. through wetland drainage, agricultural intensification, pesticide pollution, fluctuating water levels (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), beach erosion and the development or modification of foraging sites (Molina and Erwin 2006). It also suffers from reduced reproductive success as a result of human disturbance at breeding colonies (Gochfeld and Burger 1996, Molina and Erwin 2006).
B220;Hydrocoloeus_minutus;"Its habitat includes coastal areas, lagoons, sandy beaches, mouths of streams and rivers. It breeds mainly inland, from subarctic to temperate forest, at freshwater lakes, river valleys, marshes and bogs with abundant vegetation; locally at coastal lagoons; nests on sandbanks, in reedbeds and in marsh vegetation. Its diet is varied and includes mostly invertebrates. It is mainly insectivorous when breeding and during migration. During winter it may also prey on fish. Feeds by walking, and swimming; hovers in air and foot-patters on surface. Also feeds tern-like by surface-dipping, flying into wind and dropping to seize insects from surface of water. Occasionally plunge-dives (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).";;The species is threatened by habitat degradation, including changes in hydrographic conditions from damming and irrigation works (Rašomavičius 2007, Ellermaa and Linden 2011). It is vulnerable to oil spills (Mendel et al. 2008) and other types of marine pollution, including agricultural run-off (pesticides, biocides) (Ellermaa and Linden 2011). It is vulnerable to being caught as bycatch in fishing gear, including in gillnets (Zydelis et al. 2013). It is considered moderately vulnerable to collision with offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014) and can be disturbed at sea by shipping traffic.
B225;Hydroprogne_caspia;"In Europe the species occurs mostly along the Baltic Sea coast, and in the Black Sea during the breeding season, and with some year round residents in Turkey. Its habitat includes coastal areas, as well as on large inland lakes and reservoirs, breeding on sand, shell or rocky islands. It feeds in freshwater lakes, inland seas, and coastal estuaries. Its winter roosts are around large lakes and estuaries on sandbars, mudflats, shell banks. It feeds mainly on small to medium-sized fish; occasionally eggs and young of other birds, and carrion. In Scandinavia its main prey are roach (Rutilus rutilus) and herring (Clupea harengus) (Gochfeld and Burger 1996)."; and is rarely pelagic;The species is currently threatened by the loss and deterioration of breeding habitat through accelerated vegetation succession (possibly through the introduction of exotic plant species) (Shuford and Craig 2002) and may be threatened in the future by habitat loss through inundation as a result of sea-level rise (Shuford and Craig 2002). The species is vulnerable to human disturbance at nesting colonies especially during the early-courtship and incubation periods (Shuford and Craig 2002), and exposure to bioaccumulated contaminants (e.g. organochlorines or methylmercury) in fish could be lowering the species's reproductive success (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Newcastle disease (Shuford and Craig 2002, Kuiken et al. 2006) and avian botulism may also threaten concentrated local populations (Shuford and Craig 2002). It is vulnerable to oil spills and marine pollution. It is susceptible to being caught as bycatch in fishing gears.
B212;Larus_argentatus;"It winters in north and west Europe. Its habitat includes coastal and near-coastal areas and also inland localities such as large lakes and reservoirs, on fields and at rubbish dumps. It is sometimes found at sea. Its breeding habitats are varied, including coastal cliffs and stacks, rocky and grassy islands, sandy beaches, gravel bars, salt-marshes, limestone outcrops, and buildings. The species also exploits man-altered habitats such as clay pits. It is omnivorous and highly opportunistic, exploiting superabundant food when available; spans the full range of gull dietary items and feeding behaviour; powerful predator. Feeds extensively on fish, earthworms, crabs, and other marine invertebrates (molluscs, starfish) (Burger and Gochfeld 2013).";;"The species is threatened by coastal oil pollution (Gorski et al. 1977) and is susceptible to avian influenza and so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). It is susceptible to colliding with offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014). It is vulnerable to being caught as bycatch in fisheries, including longlines, trawls and gillnets (Anderson et al. 2011, Zydelis et al. 2013). 
 "
B215;Larus_armenicus;Most of this species undergoes short-distance migratory movements on a narrow front (along the rivers and deltas of Turkey) between separate breeding and wintering grounds. It winters across the south-eastern Mediterranean Sea (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).  It inhabits both inland and coastal waters, but breeding is restricted to mountain lakes, using reedbeds, beaches, and agricultural fields.  The diet of this species is little known, but may consist primarily of fish as well as terrestrial invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles and rodents (Burger and Gochfeld 1996, Adamian and Klem Jr. 1999).;;The global population of this species decreased significantly in the past as a result of persecution (due to the damage it inflicted to fisheries) and egg harvesting (Burger and Gochfeld 1996,  Olsen and Larsson 2004). The breeding success of the species was dramatically reduced after the water-level in Lake Sevan (Armenia) was lowered due to extraction for irrigation and hydropower production (Adamian and Klem Jr. 1999).
B208;Ichthyaetus_audouinii;This coastal species rarely occurs inland. Colonies are located on exposed rocky cliffs and on offshore islands or islets, normally not more than 50 m above sea level. Characteristics of habitats used differ from region to region and even within the same areas in different years: altitude ranges from close to sea-level to 100 m, vegetation cover from bare rocks to 85% bush cover, and slope from 0–90°. During the non-breeding season the species prefers sheltered bays, either flat with shingle or sand or with cliffed margins (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It breeds in large monospecific colonies ranging from 10 up to 10,000 pairs. Egg-laying takes place in the second half of April until the beginning of May, and peak hatching occurs in late May (Burger and Gochfeld 1996), with fledging mainly in the first two weeks of July (Mañosa et al. 2004). The nest is a shallow scrape lined with available debris and vegetation (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It is placed among rocks and vegetation. Clutches normally have three eggs (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). It has a large foraging range while breeding, and has been recorded up to 200 km from the colony. The diet consists mostly of epipelagic fish, especially Clupeiformes (Mañosa et al. 2004). It is also known to take some aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, small birds and plant material such as the peanut (Arachis), olive (Olea), and grain (Cramp and Simmons 1983).  It is partially migratory and dispersive (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). After breeding the birds disperse widely around the Mediterranean coast (Sanpera et al. 2007, Burger and Gochfeld 1996). Almost all juveniles and some adults migrate past Gibraltar during July-October (Olsen and Larsson 2003), peaking in August (Guitiérrez and Guinart 2008), to winter on the North African coast (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).;;The trawling fishery off the Ebro Delta is regarded as unsustainable and its collapse would probably result in a decline in the breeding population due to the increase in density-dependence (Oro et al. 2004, Tavecchia et al. 2007, Barov and Derhé 2011). A similar outcome would arise if waste from the trawlers were used industrially to produce food for domestic animals, as occurs in other areas, rather than being dumped near the Ebro colony. More important could be the reduction of small-pelagic fish stocks, the main natural prey for the species, due to increasingly high fishing pressure around the breeding grounds, owing partly to high demand by tuna-farming (Arcos et al. 2008). Other important threats include coastal tourism developments, regulation of the river Ebro, mortality due to entanglement in fishing gear (mainly longlines and sporting lines) (Belda and Sánchez 2001, Cooper et al. 2003) and predation by terrestrial predators, such as Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), Badger (Meles meles) and domestic dogs (Oro et al. 1999, Tavecchia et al. 2007). Predation by sympatric Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) can be high at some breeding colonies, especially when densities of Audouin's Gulls are low (Bonaccorsi 2003, Travichon 2004, Oro et al. 2006, Paracuellos and Nevado 2010). Predation on chicks by Black Rats (Rattus rattus) has a negative impact at some breeding colonies (Jones et al. 2008). Nevertheless this species shows a very nomadic breeding site selection and high dispersal rates from year to year, probably avoiding large densities of L. michahellis (Genovart et al. 2003, Martínez-Abraín et al. 2003, Oro and Matínez-Abraín 2007). Peregrines (Falco peregrinus), other raptors, some herons and snakes can also prey on adults and nests but only accidentally and locally (Oro 1996, 1997). Very high levels of mercury and other pollutants are found in this species (Sanpera et al. 2007), partly due to the consumption of discards (Arcos et al. 2002), thus posing a potential threat, although no negative effects have been demonstrated. Current marine wind-farm projects, particularly around the main breeding colony (Ebro Delta), could also represent a serious threat. Overgrazing of some islets by goats in the east of its breeding range may reduce breeding success. Natal and breeding dispersal are extremely high ensuring genetic mixing and buffering against bad local environmental conditions through emigration and colonisation (Oro and Ruxton 2001, Oro et al. 2004).
B214;Larus_cachinnans;"The species is found along coasts and inland habitats. In Europe, it is largely confined to coastal regions, but locally also rivers and inland lakes (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).  It breeds on rocky and sandy islands, beaches, cliffs, spits, and grassy or shrubby river islands; in flooded areas may nest on bushes; in the Black Sea it nests mainly on islands, ranging from barren to well vegetated (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).  It feeds mostly on fish, invertebrates, mammals, refuse, scraps, offal, bird eggs and chicks, and insects.";;In the Black Sea area, many nests were destroyed and adults shot during the 1940s, to reduce their predation on the 'beneficial' L. melanocephalus. Culling is also considered to protect L. audouinii from expanding L. cachinnans populations and has taken place in parts of Spain. It is a frequent victim of oil pollution in some areas (James 1984, Burger and Gochfeld 1996). Some colonies are affected by egg harvesting/collection activities.
B207;Larus_canus;Populations in Iceland, and around the North and Baltic seas are generally year-round residents, while other populations migrate between breeding and wintering grounds (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). During the winter the species expands its range to the North East Atlantic coasts of France and Portugal, the southern and eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, and the entire coasts of the Black Sea (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). Within Europe it inhabits coasts, tidal estuaries, agricultural land, reservoirs and breeds on coastal cliffs and islands, in beaches, bogs, marshes and meadows. It feeds on earthworms, insects, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, small fish and grain (in spring). It occasionally kills birds and small mammals (Burger and Gochfeld 2014).;;In its breeding grounds the species is threatened  by predation from introduced ground predators such as American Mink (Neovison vison) (Bukacińska and Bukacińska 2003), and by disturbance from tourism, angling and research activities during the laying period (Bukacińska and Bukacińska 2003). Inland populations breeding in colonies near rivers are also vulnerable to mass outbreaks of Black Flies (Simuliidae) (Bukacińska and Bukacinska 2003). The species is also threatened by the transformation and loss of its breeding habitats through land reclamation, drainage, afforestation (e.g., with conifers) and dam construction (Bukacińska and Bukacińska 2003). In its wintering range the species is potentially threatened by the activities of fisheries (e.g., reductions in fishing effort, increases in net mesh sizes and exploitation of formerly non-commercial fish species) and their effects on competition for prey resources (Bukacińska and v  2003). Other threats to wintering sites include land reclamation and drainage (Bukacińska and Bukacińska 2003). Eggs are collected from colonies in Germany, Scotland, and Poland (Bukacińska and Bukacińska 2003).
B213;Larus_fuscus;The species breeds around Scandinavia, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and northern U.K. to Iceland. It also breeds year-round on the coast of Portugal, southern Ireland, the U.K. and northern France, and one seasonally breeding population is found in north-east Spain. Seasonal breeders disperse widely, expanding its range to include the entire North Sea coast, much of the Mediterranean and Black Sea. It inhabits coastal and inland waters, estuaries, harbours, rubbish dumps, fields, but breeds mainly on sandy, rocky or grassy sea coasts, rocky islands, islands of lakes and rivers, buildings, moorland, sea cliffs (heuglini). ;It tends to avoid cliffs favoured by L. argentatus (Burger et al. 2013).;Some populations of this species have significantly declined due to decreasing food availability caused by competition and predation from Larus argentatus and Larus marinus (Barcena et al. 1984, Olsen and Larsson 2003, Burger et al. 2013) and by changes in fishing and refuse disposal practices (Olsen and Larsson 2003, Mitchell et al. 2004) (e.g. closure of landfill sites and the covering of waste) (Barcena et al. 1984, Olsen and Larsson 2003, Mitchell et al. 2004, Burger et al. 2013). Population declines may also have been aided by poisoning from organochlorine pollution (Bustnes et al. 2006).  Colonies have been culled in Britain and Ireland in order to protect other breeding seabirds, such as terns, from predation and competition (Mitchell et al. 2004). The species is hunted unsustainably in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), and is threatened by egg-collecting and general human disturbance on the Iberian Peninsula (Barcena et al. 1984). The species is susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of this disease (Mitchell et al. 2004).
B218;Chroicocephalus_genei;Within Europe this species occurs along the south and east of the Iberian Peninsula, through the Mediterranean and Black Sea. The species breeds on sand-spits, beaches (Burger and Gochfeld 1996) and islands with mudflats and marshes in shallow tidal waters (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), and on saline inland seas (Olsen and Larsson 2003). It may also frequent meadows and moist grassland by tidal inlets (Snow and Perrins 1998), and brackish or freshwater lagoons or marshes near river deltas during this season (Richards 1990, Burger and Gochfeld 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is almost entirely coastal outside of the breeding season, frequenting shallow inshore waters and salt-pans;, although it generally avoids harbours (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).;Eggs and chicks of this species are preyed upon by Larus cachinnans and Larus melanocephalus (especially where colonies are frequently disturbed by humans) (Burger and Gochfeld 1996), and storms or cold weather may threaten breeding colonies by causing nest flooding and chick mortality (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). The species is threatened by pollution from oil (Cooper et al. 1984, James 1984, Burger and Gochfeld 1996) and plastic waste, and is exploited by local people (subsistence egg collecting) in the Mediterranean (James 1984). It also suffers from disturbance caused by local people and tourists casually visiting breeding colonies, and by habitat loss resulting from tourism development (James 1984). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Gaidet et al. 2007).
B211;Larus_glaucoides;The species breeds in the Arctic regions including Greenland (to Denmark), and outside the breeding season can be found wintering in Iceland, Ireland, the U.K., the north coast of Norway, the southern tip of Scandinavia and the northern tip of Germany (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). Its habitat includes rocky coasts and fjords of low Arctic, breeding on steep cliffs, offshore stacks, sometimes undisturbed low islands. In winter it also occurs in harbours and occasionally rubbish dumps, and normally shuns fresh water (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).;;The species is extensively hunted by local people in Greenland, and increased non-native predators could also pose a hazard during the breeding season (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).
B210;Larus_hyperboreus;"This species breeds in the Arctic regions of the northern hemisphere. Birds breeding in northern Europe tend to remain near the colony year-round. Migratory populations also use the Atlantic coast of Europe down to Brittany, France including the United Kingdom and Ireland (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). Preferred habitat includes coasts, bays, harbours, landfill sites and fishing wharves. It breeds on cliffs in the Arctic and subarctic, mainly in the coastal zone or a few kilometres inland, particularly near human settlements, and often near gull or goose colonies; also on islands offshore or in lakes (Burger and Gochfeld 2014).  It feeds on fish, molluscs, crustaceans, rodents, birds, eggs and young of birds (especially ducks, auks, shorebirds), insects, berries, carrion, refuse and offal. In Iceland it consumes blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), Littorina palliata, crabs (Hyas), sea-urchins and sand eels (Ammodytes). In winter, southernmost birds feed mainly at rubbish dumps, behind ships, at sewage outfalls, and on fish offal; also exploits spawning squid, pelagic crabs, mammal carcasses, and occasionally faeces of marine mammals.";;The species is threatened by organohalogen pollution in its Arctic breeding range (Bustnes et al. 2004, Verreault et al. 2007) (there is evidence that organohalogen contaminants alter the species's basal metabolic rate (Verreault et al. 2007) and that organochlorines reduce the efficiency of its immune system (Bustnes et al. 2004)). In parts of its breeding range the species is also being displaced by Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). Young birds are hunted in Greenland, mainly between August and November (Evans 1984).
B216;Ichthyaetus_ichthyaetus;Its main habitat includes coasts and major rivers, harbours, fish ponds and rubbish dumps. It breeds on barren islands in fresh and saline lakes and in generally arid areas, preferring saline soils. It feeds chiefly on fish (particularly dead fish) and crustaceans, as well as insects, small mammals, birds, eggs and reptiles. It commonly follows fishing boats and takes fish offal in harbours. It often flies long distances from colonies to feed aerially on swarming insects (Burger et al. 2013).;;This species is threatened by increasing predation from Larus cachinnans in its breeding range, and by nest predation by mammals (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). It is also still persecuted in some regions due to its depredation on commercial fish, and colonies are often subject to flooding following storms (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of this disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B209;Larus_marinus;The species occurs along rocky or sandy coasts, estuaries and open seas, and larger inland waters, fields and moorland. It breeds on vegetated islands, dunes, flat-topped stacks, and sometimes salt-marsh islands among bushes, and locally on buildings (Burger et al. 2013). It is omnivorous and opportunistic, preying on fish, adult and young birds, bird eggs, mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, carrion, rubbish, offal and berries. Fish include cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus), and capelin (Mallotus villosus). It is an aggressive predator, particularly on eggs and chicks of L. argentatus, Rissa tridactyla, ducks, seabirds, and other species (Burger et al. 2013).;;The species is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006). It is vulnerable to collision with offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014). It is also vulnerable to being caught as bycatch in fishing gears, including longlines, trawls and gillnets (Anderson et al. 2011, Zydelis et al. 2013).  It is vulnerable to coastal oil spills and other types of surface water pollution.
B219;Ichthyaetus_melanocephalus;"Most populations are fully migratory and travel along coastlines between their breeding and wintering areas. Its preferred habitats include coasts, estuaries, harbours, marshes, inland lakes, fields and grasslands. In the Mediterranean it breeds along coasts, in coastal lagoons, steppe lakes and marshes in open lowland areas, favouring sparse vegetation; sometimes on coastal salt-marshes (NW Europe). It appears able to adapt more readily than many other species to new habitats, both breeding and wintering; in recent years has successfully colonized areas which differ markedly from its original habitats in (e.g., climate and vegetation) (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).";, but generally avoiding barren sand;This species sustains heavy losses as a result of tourist disturbance at breeding colonies (James 1984, Burger and Gochfeld 1996). The species may also be threatened by habitat loss resulting from tourism development and by marine pollution (e.g., oil spills and chemical discharges) (James 1984). Eggs are collected and adults exploited for food within Mediterranean breeding colonies, targeted by fishermen in the Mediterranean Sea (James 1984).
B217;Chtoicocephalus_ridibundus;"Some populations of this species in milder areas of Europe are resident, with the remaining populations wintering to the south over a large range, encompassing much of the southern coast of Europe. It breeds chiefly inland, with much breeding habitat created by rising water levels. It inhabits the temperate zone to the edge of boreal forests of the Palearctic; mainly at low altitudes, and generally near calm, shallow water of coastal or inland waters, including rivers and their estuaries. In winter it tends to occur far more in coastal habitats, but also inland at relatively low elevations. It relies heavily on aquatic and terrestrial insects, earthworms and marine invertebrates, and to lesser extent on fish for prey (Burger and Gochfeld 2014).";;The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases (Hubalek et al. 2005). It may also be threatened by future coastal oil spills (Gorski et al. 1977) and has suffered local population declines in the past as a result of egg collecting (Burger and Gochfeld 2014). In some areas of its breeding range the species may also suffer from reduced reproductive successes due to contamination with chemical pollutants (Burger and Gochfeld 2014).
B221;Pagophila_eburnea;This species breeds in the high Arctic, north of the July 5°C isotherm (Snow and Perrins 1998) on broad upper ledges of steep, inaccessible coastal or inland cliffs (Burger et al. 2013, Snow and Perrins 1998) up to 300 m high (Snow and Perrins 1998), on broken ice-fields or on bare, level shorelines with low rocks (Snow and Perrins 1998, Burger et al. 2013). Outside of the breeding season it associates with the edges of pack-ice, showing a preference for areas with 70–90% ice cover. It breeds between late-June and August (although most pairs do not lay until early-July, and some pairs may not breed if food conditions are unfavourable) in colonies of 5–60 pairs. The nest is constructed of moss, straw and other debris, lined with dry grass and feathers, on a snow-free area of rock. Its diet consists predominantly of fish, shrimps, shellfish, algae and carrion (e.g. seal placentae) (Burger et al. 2013). It feeds mostly by hovering and contact dipping in open leads in ice-filled waters, or scavenging on marine mammal remains (Gilg et al. 2010). This species is migratory. It departs from its breeding grounds between August and October, (Olsen and Larsson 2003) and returns in late-March at Spitsbergen and in April at Franz Josef Land. Sometimes appears as a vagrant in several countries in western and northern Europe (Burger et al. 2013).;;The species is thought to be declining due to changes in conditions on its staging or wintering grounds (e.g. more severe winters, changing sea-ice distribution and thickness) (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005). It is also hunted (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005).The species's reliance on seal and whale blubber makes it particularly vulnerable to heavy metal- contamination (Tucker and Heath 1994) as has been found outside of Europe (Braune et al. 2006) which may have had a long-term effect on breeding productivity (C. Miljeteig in litt. 2007). The levels of contaminants (e.g. organochlorines, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated alkyl substances, and mercury) recorded in eggs of the species are among the highest among reported in Arctic seabird species (Miljeteig et al. 2009).
B223;Rissa_tridactyla;In Europe this species breeds on cliffs and coastlines in both Arctic and temperate regions. This species is migratory and disperses after breeding from coastal areas to the open ocean (Burger et al. 2013). It returns to its breeding grounds from January where it breeds from mid-May to mid-June in huge single- or mixed-species colonies (Burger et al. 2013) that often exceed 100,000 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998, Burger et al. 2013). Non-breeders may also remain at sea during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). It nests on high, steep coastal cliffs with narrow ledges in areas with easy access to freshwater (Burger et al. 2013). The species moults on sandy beaches (Olsen and Larsson 2003) and on passage it may concentrate at sea on continental shelves, areas of upwelling (Burger et al. 2013) and at rich fish banks (Olsen and Larsson 2003). During the winter the species is highly pelagic, usually remaining on the wing out of sight of land (Burger et al. 2013). Its diet consists predominantly of marine invertebrates (e.g., squid and shrimps) and fish, although during the breeding season it may also take intertidal molluscs, crustaceans (Burger et al. 2013) (e.g., crayfish) (Flint et al. 1984), earthworms, small mammals and plant matter (e.g., aquatic plants, potato tubers and grain) (Burger et al. 2013). Many species of fish have been recorded in diet, but sandeels (Ammodytes), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and herring (Clupea harengus) are particularly important (Burger et al. 2013).;;The species is threatened by the depletion of food resources (e.g. through over-fishing) (Frederiksen et al. 2004, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), marine oil spills (Nikolaeva et al. 2006, Burger et al. 2013) and chronic oil pollution (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). It is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c. 10° latitude from the polar edge of continent and within which 20–50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under doubling of CO2 levels (BirdLife International, unpublished data). It is caught as bycatch in longline fisheries, with significant numbers estimated to be caught off the western coast of Ireland and the U.K.. The species is considered a high risk for collision with offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014). The species is hunted in the Faroe Islands and in Greenland (Labansen et al. 2010, Burger et al. 2013, Thorup et al. 2014).
B228;Sterna_dougallii;The species nests on sand-dunes, sand-spits, shingle beaches, reefs (Snow and Perrins 1998), saltmarshes and rocky, sandy or coral islands, showing a preference for densely vegetated sites in temperate regions (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). It also shows a preference for nest sites close to clear, shallow, sandy fishing grounds in tidal bays and sheltered inshore waters (Snow and Perrins 1998). Throughout the year the species often rests and forages in sheltered estuaries, creeks (Urban et al. 1986), inshore waters and up to several kilometres offshore (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), moving to warm tropical coasts after breeding (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds in large, dense single- or mixed-species colonies that may contain several thousands of pairs.  The nest is a bare scrape in sand, shingle or coral rubble (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), preferably in sites surrounded by walls and rocks (Newton and Crowe 2000) or in the shelter of vegetation (in temperate regions) (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), also in crevices between and under rocks, or in the entrances to rabbit or Puffin burrows (Snow and Perrins 1998). Clutches are normally two eggs but can be only one in poor food years (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). This species is a specialist forager, and takes a small prey spectrum compared to Common Tern at the same sites (Birdlife International 2000). Its diet consists predominantly of small pelagic fish (Urban et al. 1986, Gochfeld and Burger 1996), particularly sand eel (Birdlife International 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000) and sprat (Birdlife International 2000) and sometimes clupeids (Birdlife International 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000) and gadoids (Newton and Crowe 2000), although it will also take insects and marine invertebrates (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Sandeel are particularly important during chick rearing (Newton and Crowe 2000). The species is migratory and Palearctic birds winter in west Africa (Gochfeld and Burger 1996).;;The species is threatened by a number of agents, of which hunting in the wintering quarters may be the most significant (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Buckley and Buckley 1984, Cooper et al. 1984, Avery et al. 1995). At the northern European breeding grounds, the most significant threats are human disturbance (e.g., from habitat development, off-road vehicles and recreation (Buckley and Buckley 1984, van Halewyn and Norton 1984)) and predation from both natural and introduced avian and ground predators (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Buckley and Buckley 1984, Cooper et al. 1984, van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Avery et al. 1995, Snow and Perrins 1998). Disturbance and egg-collecting have been stopped in most areas by the use of wardens, but disturbance still threatens some major colonies in the Azores (van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Predation by rats, ferrets, red foxes and Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) occurs locally, and can have significant effects, including complete breeding failure at some Azores colonies (Avery et al. 1995). Natural predators can often take a great toll on localised colonies, particularly when terns are disturbed from the nest by other birds and humans (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Cooper et al. 1984). Habitat loss in northern Europe is not a major problem but has caused the local extinction of some colonies, as have extreme weather events (Avery et al. 1995). Climate change may negatively affect the species but the exact mechanisms are not known (Newbery 1999). The species is also vulnerable to pollution and disease (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Avery et al. 1995).
B229;Sterna_hirundo;This species breeds in a wide variety of habitats in coastal and inland areas from sea-level to heights of greater than 4,000 m (Gochfeld et al. 2013). Along the coast it shows a preference for nesting on flat rock surfaces on inshore islands (Snow and Perrins 1998), open shingle and sandy beaches, dunes and spits (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), vegetated inter-dune areas, sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in estuaries (Gochfeld et al. 2013) and coastal lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998), saltmarshes (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), mainland peninsulas (Snow and Perrins 1998) and grassy plateauxs atop coastal cliffs (Gochfeld et al. 2013). Inland it may nest in similar habitats including sand or shingle lakes shores (Richards 1990), shingle banks in rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in lakes and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), sand- or gravel-pits (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes, ponds, grassy areas and patches of dredged soil (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds between April and June in solitary pairs or colonially in groups of up to several thousand pairs (inland colonies often smaller and more widely-dispersed than coastal ones). The nest is a shallow depression on open substrates with little or no vegetation placed near a vertical object (e.g. rock, shell, plant or artefact) to provide shelter for chicks and to facilitate nest identification. Nest sites include the edges of bare sand amongst vegetation, rocks or logs, open areas on the margins of vegetation on beaches, the edges of mats of vegetation in marshes, and grassy or rocky substrates on rocky islets. The species will also readily nest on artificial rafts. Clutches at higher latitudes are normally three eggs, however this is affected by food availability. It is an opportunistic feeder, its diet consisting predominantly of small fish and occasionally planktonic crustaceans and insects. This species is a strongly migratory coastal seabird (Snow and Perrins 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013). Palearctic breeders migrate south after breeding between August and October, returning to the breeding grounds in March or April (Gochfeld et al. 2013).;;During the breeding season the species is vulnerable to human disturbance at nesting colonies (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Blokpoel and Scharf 1991) (e.g. from off-road vehicles, recreation, motor-boats, personal watercraft and dogs) (van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Hyde 1997, Burger 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2013), and to the flooding of nest sites as a result of naturally fluctuating water levels (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2013). On its breeding grounds the species is also threatened by habitat loss as a result of coastal development (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2013), erosion (Hyde 1997), vegetation overgrowth (rapid vegetation succession encroaching upon nesting habitats) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Hyde 1997Gochfeld et al. 2013), and chemical pollution (which may also result in eggshell thinning) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2013). It suffers predation at nesting colonies from rats (especially on islands) (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Gochfeld et al. 2013) and from expanding populations of large gull species (Brown and Nettleship 1984, Gochfeld et al. 2013) such as Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) (Buckley and Buckley 1984) (gulls may also prevent the species from nesting in the area by colonising it first) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991, Gochfeld et al. 2013). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Other threats include organochlorine pollution, over-fishing by man (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and fatalities from wind turbine collisions (Everaert and Stienen 2007).
B230;Sterna_paradisaea;The species breeds along northern coastlines (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and on inshore islands, as well as inland on tundra and forest-tundra (Flint et al. 1984). It shows a preference for habitats with a vegetation cover of less than 40%, nesting on sand or shingle beaches, ridges (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and spits, rocky ground and small islands (Flint et al. 1984) in lakes and coastal lagoons (Gochfeld et al. 2014). It may also nest on islets or banks along rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), on swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and reed-covered flats (Flint et al. 1984), or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and sedge grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998) not far from water (Flint et al. 1984). The species also forages offshore, in ice-filled coastal bays or over wet tundra (Gochfeld et al. 2014). On passage it largely flies over open ocean (Snow and Perrins 1998) resting at sea on kelp, logs or flotsam, but may occur inland or along coastlines on beaches, reefs and spits (Higgins and Davies 1996). It breeds between May and July (although the exact timing varies with temperature and food availability) in solitary pairs or colonies of a few to several hundred pairs (usually 2–25). The nest is a shallow scrape (Gochfeld et al. 2014) in sand, shingle or turf (Richards 1990) on beaches, ridges and spits, rocky ground, small islands  in lakes, coastal lagoons (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and reed-covered flats (Flint et al. 1984), or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows (Gochfeld et al. 2014) and sedge grassland (Snow and Perrins 1998) not far from water (Flint et al. 1984). It will also nest on artificial structures. Clutches are two to three eggs. Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans (especially planktonic species), molluscs, insects (e.g. caterpillars, Chironomidae) and earthworms. It will also take berries in the early spring on arrival on its breeding grounds but does not readily switch to other prey items when preferred prey supplies fail. The species is a very strong migrant and makes exceptional long-distance movements offshore or along western continental coastlines (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gochfeld et al. 2014) between its high Arctic breeding grounds and Antarctic wintering grounds (Gochfeld et al. 2014).;;The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c.10° latitude from the polar edge of continent within  20–50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under a doubling of CO2 levels (Birdlife International, unpublished data). In many parts of Scandinavia, declines have been caused in the past by egg collecting, however this has decreased in recent years allowing the population to recover (Gochfeld et al. 2014). In some areas predation by Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (Horobin 1971) and American Mink (Mustela vison) can be a problem (Hagemeijer and Balir 1997) and mortality has been recorded as a result of red tide (Horobin 1971). In northern Britain the collapse of sand eel stocks have caused a crash in the population and in Svalbard the population may be vulnerable to oil, particularly in the post-breeding period (Gochfeld et al. 2014). Pollution is likely a major factor in the species's decline and yachting and other leisure activities have led to an increase in disturbance. Declines have also been correlated with gull abundance (Hagemijer and Blair 1997).
B231;Sternula_albifrons;"The species is mainly coastal, but is also found inland along rivers and on oceanic islands. It breeds on barren or sparsely vegetated sandy, shell and rocky islands, shingle beaches, spits in estuaries and lakes, salt-marshes, salt-pans and rivers. Outside of the breeding season it frequents tidal creeks, coastal lagoons and salt-pans; sometimes feeds far out to sea (Gochfeld and Burger 1996). It feeds mainly on small fish and crustaceans, also insects, annelids and molluscs. The main fish species include sand eels (Ammodytes), roach (Rutilus rutilus), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus), carp (Cyprinus carpio), perch (Perca fluviatilis). It specializes in prolonged hovering and plunge-diving into shallow water, often at edge of advancing tide. Groups of birds may dive synchronously (Gochfeld and Burger 1996).";;The species is threatened by habitat destruction (Barcena et al. 1984) such as the development and industrial reclamation of coastal breeding habitats (Barcena et al. 1984, Gochfeld and Burger 1996) (e.g. for the development of new harbour facilities) (Barcena et al. 1984). It is also highly vulnerable to human disturbance (including birdwatchers) at coastal and inland nesting sites which can lead to nest failures (Barcena et al. 1984, Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Pesticide pollution (e.g. organochlorine pollutants, mercury and DDT) (Barcena et al. 1984, Thyen et al. 2000, Choi et al. 2001) and artificially induced water-level fluctuations in saltmarshes (Barcena et al. 1984) may also pose a threat to the species's reproductive success (Barcena et al. 1984, Thyen et al. 2000, Choi et al. 2001). The species also suffers from local egg collecting (Barcena et al. 1984) and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B227;Thalasseus_sandvicensis;During the breeding season the species forms colonies on sandy islands, rocky calcareous islets, sand-spits, sand-dunes, shingle beaches and extensive deltas with immediate access to clear waters with shallow sandy substrates rich in surface-level fish (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for raised, open, unvegetated sand, gravel, mud or bare coral substrates for nesting. Outside of the breeding season the species frequents sandy or rocky beaches, estuaries, harbours and bays, often feeding over inlets and at sea. It breeds from May to June in dense colonies with other terns or Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus). The nest is a shallow scrape on raised, open, unvegetated sand, gravel, mud or bare coral substrates preferably far from upright vegetation (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) on sandy islands, rocky calcareous islets, sand-spits, sand-dunes and shingle beaches (Snow and Perrins 1998). Clutches are one or two eggs. The species forms very dense colonies during the breeding season in which the eggs of neighbouring pairs may only be 20 cm apart. Its diet consists predominantly of surface-dwelling marine fish (Snow and Perrins 1998) 9–15 cm long, as well as small shrimps, marine worms and shorebird nestlings. This species is migratory, undergoing post-breeding dispersive movements north and south to favoured feeding grounds before migrating southward (Gochfeld and Burger 1996).;;The species is particularly vulnerable to human disturbance (Gochfeld and Burger 1996) (e.g. from tourists) especially near breeding colonies on beaches early in the breeding season (Bourne and Smith 1974). It is also sensitive to disturbance from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) (Garthe and Huppop 2004). It is threatened by the loss or degradation of its favoured breeding habitats through inundation, wind-blown sand and erosion (Gochfeld and Burger 1996), and has suffered previous local declines from exposure to bioaccumulated organochlorine pollutants in marine fish (Koeman et al. 1967, Gochfeld and Burger 1996). Other serious threats include recreational disturbance, coastal developments, pollution, land-use affecting vegetation and predation (Garthe and Flore 2007).
B222;Xema_sabini;In the Arctic it occupies the tundra, breeding at wetlands with mosses and sedges. It is pelagic in winter. Its prey includes invertebrates and small fish and occasionally small birds and eggs of Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea) and of conspecifics. It also feeds on carrion and fish discards. Breeding birds feed mainly on terrestrial prey in marshes. During the non-breeding season it feeds by swooping low over water and snatches prey from surface and sometimes swims, or feeds on land (Burger and Gochfeld 2013).;;No specific information on threats to this species has been recorded within Europe, however as an Arctic breeding species, it is likely to be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including habitat change and ecosystem shifts (Ganter and Gaston, 2013). Beyond Europe, the species is hunted in Russia, including egg harvesting (Merkel and Barry 2008).
B156;Himantopus_himantopus;"BehaviourNorthern populations of this species make long-distance migratory movements, travelling southwards to their wintering grounds between August and November and returning to their breeding areas between March and April (Hayman et al. 1986). In more temperate regions the species is sedentary or only locally dispersive however (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds solitarily or in loose colonies of 2-50 or occasionally up to several hundred pairs (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is typically a gregarious species, occurring in small groups (Snow and Perrins 1998) (up to 15 individuals) (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or larger flocks of several hundred up to a thousand individuals on migration, during the winter (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) and at nightly roosts (Urban et al. 1986).

Habitat Breeding The species typically breeds in shallow freshwater and brackish wetlands with sand, mud or clay substrates and open margins, islets or spits near water level (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable habitats include marshes and swamps, shallow lake edges, riverbeds, flooded fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996), irrigated areas (Snow and Perrins 1998), sewage ponds (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and fish-ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also breed around alkaline and high-altitude (montane) lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1996) or in more saline environments such as river deltas, estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow coastal pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species occupies the shores of large inland waterbodies and estuarine or coastal habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) such as river deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) and shallow freshwater or brackish pools with extensive areas of mudflats, salt meadows (Johnsgard 1981), saltpans, coastal marshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998).

Diet Its diet is strongly seasonal (del Hoyo et al. 1996) but generally includes adult and larval aquatic insects (e.g. Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, Diptera, Neuroptera and Lepidoptera), molluscs, crustaceans, spiders, oligochaete and polychaete worms, tadpoles (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and amphibian spawn (Urban et al. 1986), small fish, fish eggs (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and occasionally seeds (Urban et al. 1986).

Breeding site The nest is a depression (Flint et al. 1984) or shallow scrape positioned on hard ground near water on a hummock (Flint et al. 1984) or amongst grass and sedge (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Alternatively the nest may be a more elaborate platform of vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) constructed on a floating mass of aquatic vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species nests singly or in loose colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1996), showing a preference for open areas close to foraging sites with good all-round (360 degree) visibility (Johnsgard 1981).";;
B157;Recurvirostra_avosetta;Northern populations migrate south between August and October and return to the breeding grounds between March and May, staging on route in large numbers at certain sites (Pierce and Boesman 2013). The species is present all year round in parts of Western Europe (Hayman et al. 1986, Pierce and Boesman 2013). It breeds from April to August in large colonies (Pierce and Boesman 2013) usually of between 10 and 70 pairs (Johnsgard et al. 1981). The species breeds in flat open areas (Pierce and Boesman 2013) on shallow saline or brackish wetlands (Johnsgard et al. 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998, Pierce and Boesman 2013) with islands, ridges, spits or margins of bare sand, clay or mud (Snow and Perrins 1998) and sparse short vegetation (Hayman et al. 1986), including inland lakes, pools, coastal lagoons, estuaries, saltpans (Pierce and Boesman 2013), saltmarshes, irrigated land and flood-plains in arid areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). The most important characteristics of breeding habitats appear to be water levels which gradually decline over the summer to expose additional feeding areas, and high salt concentrations that prevent the development of excessive emergent and shoreline vegetation (Johnsgard et al. 1981). Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits coastal and inland saline lakes and mudflats, lagoons, pools, saltpans, estuaries (Pierce and Boesman 2013), sandy beaches, river deltas and flood-plains (Urban et al. 1986).Its diet consists predominantly of aquatic invertebrates 4–15 cm long including aquatic insects (Pierce and Boesman 2013) (e.g. small beetles, midges and brine flies) (Johnsgard et al. 1981), crustaceans (Pierce and Boesman 2013) (e.g. Corophium spp.) (Johnsgard et al. 1981), oligochaete and polychaete worms, and molluscs, as well and small fish (Pierce and Boesman 2013) (e.g. sole) (Urban et al. 1986) and plant matter (Pierce and Boesman 2013) (e.g. seeds and small roots) (Urban et al. 1986). The nest is a scrape (Pierce and Boesman 2013) that may be positioned in a variety of sites including on bare sand (Johnsgard et al. 1981), dried mud, short grass (Urban et al. 1986), dead vegetation and built-up mounds of debris (Johnsgard et al. 1981). The species nests in large colonies and neighbouring nests are usually one metre apart (Hayman et al. 1986) or occasionally as close as 20–30 cm (Urban et al. 1986).; It rarely occurs on inland freshwater lakes and rivers (Urban et al. 1986, Pierce and Boesman 2013) but may forage on agricultural land (Pierce and Boesman 2013). ;The species is threatened in Europe by the pollution of wetlands with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), insecticides, selenium, lead and mercury (Pierce and Boesman 2013). Important wintering sites (e.g. in Portugal) are also threatened by infrastructure development (Pierce and Boesman 2013), land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). The species is susceptible to avian botulism (Blaker 1967, Hubalek et al. 2005) and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.
B190;Actitis_hypoleucos;This species is a full migrant, migrating at night overland on a broad front across both deserts and mountains (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Small numbers may also remain in the northern maritime climatic zone (e.g. the British Isles and Mediterranean) throughout the year (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The European population that overwinters in West Africa migrates south between mid-July and August (juveniles following one month later, and returns to the breeding grounds from late March to April (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Immature individuals may also remain in the winter range throughout the summer breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds from May to June in scattered single pairs 60?70 m apart in optimal breeding habitat, and migrates singly or in small flocks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), although it usually remains solitary in its winter range (Urban et al. 1986). It forages diurnally (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and may aggregate at night (Johnsgard 1981) into roosts of over 100 individuals (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During the breeding season this species shows a preference for pebbly, sandy or rocky margins of fast-flowing rivers (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), as well as small ponds, pools (Snow and Perrins 1998) and dams (Urban et al. 1986), clear freshwater lake shores, sheltered sea coasts with rocky or sandy beaches, tidal creeks and estuaries (Urban et al. 1986), and often forages in patches of dry meadow (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In its winter range this species inhabits a wide variety of habitats, such as small pools, ditches, riverbanks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), streams, dam shores (Yalden 1992), marshy areas (Johnsgard 1981), estuaries, freshwater seeps on coastal shores and saltmarshes, harbours, docks (Yalden 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and filtration tanks of sewage works (Yalden 1992). It will also forage on grassland along roadsides. The diet of this species consists of adult and larval insects (such as beetles and Diptera), spiders, molluscs, snails, crustaceans, annelids, and occasionally frogs, toads, tadpoles and small fish, as well as plant material (including seeds) (Urban et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is a shallow depression, sometimes amongst shrubs and trees (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).; and occasionally in gardens (Yalden 1992, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), but it generally avoids large coastal mudflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996);The size of the breeding population in England is threatened by disturbance from recreational anglers (Yalden 1992).
B191;Arenaria_interpres;This species is fully migratory (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It breeds from May to early-August (Hayman et al. 1986), although several pairs may nest close together in optimal habitats (Johnsgard 1981) along coasts or on islands (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species migrates in large flocks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and is gregarious and sociable when feeding or roosting in winter (Snow and Perrins 1998), often foraging in close flocks of 10?100 or more individuals, especially in tidal areas (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species breeds near the coast or up to several kilometres inland (Snow and Perrins 1998) in the high Arctic (Hayman et al. 1986), nesting on coastal plains, marshes and tundra (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and showing a preference for mosaics of bare rock, clay or shingle and vegetation near water (Snow and Perrins 1998) or in areas that remain damp until late summer (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season the species is mainly coastal, although on migration it may occur inland along dykes or on lake shores (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During the winter it frequents productive rocky and shingle shores (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), breakwaters, short-grass saltmarshes, sheltered inlets, estuaries, mudflats with beds of molluscs (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), sandy beaches with storm-wrecked seaweed (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). On its Arctic breeding grounds the species takes Diptera (especially adult and larval midges) as well as larval Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and spiders, occasionally also taking vegetable matter early in the season. Outside of the breeding season its diet consists of insects, crustaceans, molluscs, annelids, echinoderms, small fish, carrion and birds eggs. The nest is a shallow depression (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) in mud, peat or on dry ground (Johnsgard 1981) with dense vegetation (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), often positioned on a slight ridge, hummock or tussock, or in a cleft or shallow fissure (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species usually nests solitarily, although neighbouring pairs may nest as little as 15 m apart along coasts or on islands (where abundant feeding habitats are available) (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The species suffers nest predation from feral American Mink (Neovison vison) in some regions (Nordstrom et al. 2003), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B193;Calidris_alba;This species is a full long-distance migrant that travels mainly via offshore and coastal routes using a number of favoured stopover sites. It breeds from June to mid-July in solitary pairs (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), departing the breeding grounds between mid-July and early-September (Hayman et al. 1986). The species usually occurs in small flocks on migration (Johnsgard 1981) although it may aggregate into larger flocks at stopover sites (Hayman et al. 1986), and in winter it forages in small to very large flocks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species breeds in the high Arctic on barren, stony tundra with well-drained ridges (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), gentle slopes or level alluvial plains supporting scattered vegetation of willow Salix spp., Dryas spp. and saxifrage Saxifraga spp. usually less than 200 m above sea-level (Johnsgard 1981). On passage the species may occur on inland freshwater or saline lakes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) but it is largely coastal during the winter, inhabiting open sandy beaches exposed to the sea, the outer reaches of estuaries, rocky and muddy shores and mudflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). When breeding the species takes insects (especially adult and larval Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) as well as spiders and crustaceans (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). On arrival on the breeding grounds the species may also complement its diet with plant matter (e.g. seeds, saxifrage buds, moss and algae) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) before invertebrate prey becomes available (Johnsgard 1981). During the winter its diet consists of small molluscs, crustaceans, polychaete worms and adult, larval and pupal insects (e.g. Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera), as well as occasionally fish and carrion. The nest is a shallow depression on bare earth (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) of stony well-drained ridges, gentle slopes or level alluvial plains (Johnsgard 1981).;;The species is sensitive to disturbance on beaches (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. from recreational activities and free-running dogs (Thomas et al. 2003)), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B197;Calidris_alpina;This species is a fully migratory circumpolar breeder with several sub-populations that employ a number of migration strategies, from short coastal flights to long, non-stop flights overland on a broad front. The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey et al. 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;;This species is significantly threatened by the loss of its breeding habitat though afforestation of moorland (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Lavers and Haines-Young 1997). It may also suffer from nest predation by introduced mammals (e.g. European hedgehog Erinaceus europeaus) on some islands (Jackson 2001). In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass Spartina anglica which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton et al. 2002b). Important migratory stop-over habitats on the Baltic Sea coastline adjacent to the Kaliningrad region of Russia are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, peat-extraction, reedbed mowing and burning, and abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1 in particular) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B192;Calidris_canutus;This species is a full long-distance migrant that utilises few stopover sites or staging areas (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species breeds from June to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), travelling in flocks on migration (Hayman et al. 1986) and remaining highly gregarious in winter often foraging in flocks of 300–10,000 individuals (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) at select feeding and roosting sites (Hayman et al. 1986). The species breeds in the high Arctic (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) on dry upland tundra including weathered sandstone ridges, upland areas with scattered willows (Salix spp.), Dryas spp. and poppy, moist marshy slopes and flats in foothills, well-drained slopes hummocked with Dryas spp. (Johnsgard 1981) and upland glacial gravel close to streams or ponds. Outside of the breeding season the species is strictly coastal, frequenting tidal mudflats or sandflats, sandy beaches of sheltered coasts, rocky shelves, bays, lagoons and harbours, occasionally also oceanic beaches and saltmarshes. During the breeding season the species's diet consists predominantly of insects (mainly adult and larval Diptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and bees) as well as spiders, small crustaceans, snails and worms (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). When it first arrives on the breeding grounds however, the species is dependant upon vegetation (including the seeds of sedges, horsetails (Equisetum spp.) and grass shoots) owing to the initial lack of insect prey (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season the species takes intertidal invertebrates such as bivalve and gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. horseshoe crab (Limulus spp.) eggs) (Karpanty et al. 2006), annelid worms and insects, rarely also taking fish and seeds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is an open shallow depression (Flint et al. 1984) either positioned on hummocks surrounded by mud and water or on stony or gravelly ground (Johnsgard 1981) on open vegetated tundra or stone ridges (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;;The species is vulnerable to extensive land reclamation projects that encroach upon staging areas in Western Europe (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and is threatened by the over-exploitation of shellfish (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Goldfeder and Blanco 2006) which leads directly and indirectly to reductions in prey availability (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species also suffers from disturbance in the non-breeding season as a result of tourism (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006), foot-traffic on beaches (Burton et al. 2002), recreational activities and over-flying aircraft, which together reduce the size of available foraging areas (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B199;Limicola_falcinellus;"This species is a full migrant, and migrates on a broad front (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) by making short flights between a series of stop-over sites (Verkuil et al. 2006). Adults breeding in Fennoscandia leave the breeding grounds in July (juveniles departing in August), and stop-over in substantial numbers in Sivash, southern Ukraine, on the Middle Eastern coasts, Caspian Sea and Bulgarian seaboard, before arriving in wintering grounds in Africa, Pakistan and south India between August and early-October (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). A few non-breeding birds also remain at the wintering sites during the summer. Breeding occurs in early- to late-June in Fennoscandia, and between mid-June and early July in Russia, pairs nesting in loose colonies of 2–10 nests, usually spaced 80–100 m apart. The species migrates singly or in small groups, although during the spring migration flocks of up to several hundred can occur (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species breeds in the wettest parts of bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and on open peatland; the Scandinavian and north-west Russian populations breeding in the subarctic montane and lowland zones above 200 m (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (around 1,000 m in Norway) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and the Siberian population breeding in wet Arctic tundra (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of marine nereid worms, small bivalves and snails, crustaceans (e.g., amphipods), adult and larval insects (e.g., beetles, flies, grasshoppers, ants) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), as well as the seeds of aquatic plants (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a cup on top of a wet sedge or moss cushion, well raised above the water level (Johnsgard 1981).";;Local exctinctions have occurred in Norway as a result of habitat changes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), most likely through drainage and flooding of its breeding habitats. In Finland some of the most suitable peatland areas have been flooded to create artificial lakes but over all there do not appear to be any large-scale threats to the species or its breeding habitats (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B198;Calidris_maritima;This species is fully migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998, Van Gils et al. 2013). It arrives on the breeding grounds from mid-May to mid-June where it nests in solitary pairs (Van Gils et al. 2013) and forages in small loose groups (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds on Arctic coasts (Hayman et al. 1986) and in upland areas (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, Hayman et al. 1986), nesting close to the fringes of snow and ice, on wet moss or barren rocky tundra with patches of lichen and Dryas spp., on rocky islands and islets or on shingle beaches (Van Gils et al. 2013). It forages on dry tundra or along the moist margins of ponds, at the edges of melting snow-drifts and in areas of thick moss (Hayman et al. 1986). During the winter and on passage the species shows a preference for tidal rocky shores with strong wave action (Hayman et al. 1986) and suitable high-tide roosting areas (Van Gils et al. 2013), often utilising artificial structures such as concrete sea defences and breakwaters (Hayman et al. 1986). In some northern areas (e.g. Svalbard) the species frequents mudflats, shingle beaches and coastal lagoons before and after breeding but before migrating south (Van Gils et al. 2013). During the breeding season its diet consists largely of insects (e.g., adult, larval and pupal Diptera, Ichneumon wasps and aphids) and Collembola (springtails), as well as spiders, gastropods, annelid worms and some plant material (e.g. leaves, buds, berries and seeds) (Van Gils et al. 2013). On the coast the species feeds predominantly upon molluscs (especially gastropods Littorina spp. and mussels Mytilus spp.) as well as insects (e.g. beetles and Diptera), small crustaceans (e.g. amphipods), annelid worms (Van Gils et al. 2013), small fish (Johnsgard 1981) and algae (Enteromorpha spp.). The nest is a small scrape positioned in the open on tundra moss (Van Gils et al. 2013), in hummocky tundra (Flint et al. 1984) close to tufts of Dryas spp. or Arctostaphylos spp. (Johnsgard 1981), or in rocky or pebbly areas between cliffs (Flint et al. 1984).;;The species is likely to be affected by climate change (Rehfisch et al. 2004). It is also vulnerable to disturbance (Burton et al. 1996).
B194;Calidris_minuta;This species is a full long-distance migrant that migrates overland on a broad front (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (or by utilising a great many routes) (Snow and Perrins 1998) across much of the Western Palearctic (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). During the breeding season this species inhabits low altitude tundra in the high Arctic (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (although it exceptionally occurs above 1,000 m in the west of its range) (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for dry ground among dwarf willows near swampy areas or saltmarshes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), or areas where mosses and sedges are interspersed with hummocks covered by Empetrum (Johnsgard 1981).  On migration this species is found along the muddy edges of small inland lakes, reservoirs, sewage farms (Johnsgard 1981), riverbanks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and seasonal pools (Snow and Perrins 1998), as well as on coastal mudflats and seashores (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In its winter range the species mainly inhabits coastal areas such as estuarine mudflats and sandflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Hockey et al. 2005), enclosed lagoons, tidal creeks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and saltpans (Urban et al. 1986), but it also occurs at inland freshwater wetlands such as open pools in marshes, paddyfields, jheels (and other small bodies of water covered with vegetation) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), small dams, floodwater margins and sandbanks along rivers (Urban et al. 1986). The diet of this species consists chiefly of invertebrates (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). During the breeding season larval and adult Diptera and small beetles are the primary foods (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), particularly the larvae of mosquitoes and craneflies (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season the diet becomes more varied, with ants, Hymenoptera, waterbugs, annelids, small molluscs, crustaceans, freshwater mites and plant material being taken as well as Diptera and beetles (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is a shallow cup (Snow and Perrins 1998) on the ground in the open (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), sometimes covered with vegetation (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;It avoids areas where annual rainfall exceeds 250 mm (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;This species is susceptible to avian malaria (Mendes et al. 2005) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.
B200;Philomachus_pugnax;The species inhabits tundra habitats from the coast to the Arctic treeline (Johnsgard et al. 1981, Van Gils et al. 2014) during the breeding season, requiring adjacent foraging, lekking and nesting areas (Van Gils et al. 2014). It shows a preference for dry mounds and slopes with low willow (Salix spp.) and dwarf birch (Betula spp.) as lekking areas (Van Gils et al. 2014, Snow and Perrins 1998), and dry patches of tall sedge as nesting sites. Suitable foraging habitats include littoral belts, deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal saltmarshes (Johnsgard et al. 1981) and extensive lowland freshwater wetlands such as small shallow lakes with marginal vegetation, grassy hummocky marshes (Johnsgard et al. 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils et al. 2014, Snow and Perrins 1998), and damp swampy grasslands, with shallow pools or ditches. During the non-breeding season the species occupies the muddy margins of brackish, saline and alkaline lakes, ponds, pools, rivers, marshes and flood-plains, as well as freshly mown or grazed short-sward grasslands and wheat fields, usually roosting at night in the shallow waters of lake shores (Van Gils et al. 2014). It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) with males gathering in suitable lekking areas to display and females nesting solitarily or in semi-colonial groups. The nest is concealed in marsh plants or meadow grass and is a shallow scrape lined with grass, leaves and stems. Clutches are generally four eggs but sometimes three. During the breeding season it feeds on mainly terrestrial and aquatic insects. Outside of the breeding season its diet is more varied, including small crustaceans, spiders, small molluscs, annelid worms, frogs and small fish (Van Gils et al. 2014). This species is fully migratory and the bulk of the population winters in sub-Saharan Africa. However small numbers do winter in north-west Europe, in southern Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997);;The species is threatened by petroleum pollution (Grishanov 2006), wetland and flood-plain drainage (Grishanov 2006, Van Gils and Garcia 2014) (for irrigation and water management) (Grishanov 2006), peat-extraction, and land abandonment and changing land management practices that lead to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species may also suffer future population declines and range contractions as a result of global climate change (Zöckler 2002), and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007), avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974, Hubalek et al. 2005) and avian malaria (Mendes et al. 2005), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.
B195;Calidris_temminckii;This species is a full migrant, migrating on a broad front (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) overland across the full width of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East (Snow and Perrins 1998). This species breeds in arctic tundra, shrub tundra and forest tundra along flood-plains (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is mainly found near coastal inlets, fjords, deltas, rivers or streams from sea level to 250 m, but also occurs up to 1,200 m inland (Snow and Perrins 1998) on flat, clear ground with little vegetation, areas covered with short grass and interspersed with patches of scrub (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), areas with grasses, sedges or Empetrum, and scrub willow or birch thickets with sandy or gravelly stretches (Johnsgard 1981). Both dry and wet areas are used, but habitats with elevated locations such as boulders or buildings are preferred because of their use as song perches (Johnsgard 1981). In Scandinavia the species also breeds near fishing huts and houses, and in industrial workings (Ronka 1996). Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits inland freshwater wetlands such as flood-lands, irrigated fields, sewage farms, densely vegetated wetlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), ditches, muddy marshes and lake edges (Urban et al. 1986), and on the coast shows a strong preference for mudflats in sheltered inlets, estuaries and saltmarshes. On the breeding grounds and in inland habitats the diet of this species consists primarily of insects and their larvae (especially beetles and Diptera such as craneflies and midges) (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), as well as the occasional plant matter. On the coasts the species takes annelids, crustaceans (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (such as sand fleas) (Johnsgard 1981) and small molluscs (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is a shallow cup (Snow and Perrins 1998) on the ground in the open or amongst low vegetation (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), often at the base of small willows, junipers or other shrubs (Johnsgard 1981).;, although it avoids extremely cold conditions and exposed coasts (Snow and Perrins 1998).. , whilst tending to avoid open and sandy beaches (Snow and Perrins 1998);This species is threatened by nest predation (Koivula and Ronka 1998, Ronka et al. 2006) from Common Gull (Larus canus) and Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) (Ronka et al. 2006), as well as from Hooded Crow (Corvus corone cornix), weasel (Mustela nivalis), American Mink (Mustela vison) and fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Finland (Ronka 1996). It is also threatened in its Scandinavian breeding range by shrinkage and deterioration of suitable habitats (due to eutrophication and the overgrazing of shore meadows), and by increased human recreational disturbance due to the building up of breeding sites (trampling and disturbance often lead to increased hatchling predation and abandonment of nests) (Ronka 1996). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza and may therefore be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B178;Gallinago_gallinago;"This species is mostly migratory, wintering in Europe and Africa. Some populations are sedentary or partially migratory, e.g. British Isles. The birds move quickly from breeding grounds to moulting areas, and after a few weeks quickly migrate to the wintering grounds. The species shows a high degree of site fidelity at staging sites. Birds wintering in the Afrotropics thought to be from Russia, crossing the Sahara on a broad front. European and Atlantic birds move to southern and western Europe. The species seems to have shifted its main moulting grounds from continental (particularly Netherlands) to Britain since late 1950s. Autumn passage is from late July to November, with arrival in Northern Africa mainly late September to early October. Most birds leave Africa for spring migration in March; crossing Europe from March to early May. The males typically arrive on the breeding grounds 10–14 days before the females. The species breeds in open fresh or brackish marshland with rich or tussocky vegetation, grassy or marshy edges of lakes and rivers, wet hay fields, swampy meadows and marshy tundra, in forest tundra and extreme northern taiga zones. The species breeds in general in areas providing combination of grassy cover and moist soils, rich in organic matter. Outside breeding season, generally occupies similar habitats, with more use of man-made habitats, e.g. sewage farms and rice fields, upper reaches of estuaries and coastal meadows. Its diet includes larval insects (10–80%), adult insects, earthworms, small crustaceans, small gastropods and spiders. Plant fibres and seeds are consumed in smaller quantities. It feeds by vertical and rhythmic probing in substrate, often without removing the bill from the soil. It typically forages in small groups. Laying April-June. Monogamous, but both sexes show high degree of promiscuity. Territorial; densities up to 10–38 (even 110) pairs/km2. Nest usually on dry spot, covered by grasses, rushes, sedges or sphagnum. High proportion of the nests may be predated or trampled by cattle (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).";;The decline noted in breeding populations of Europe is probably chiefly due to habitat changes, especially drainage. In Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, a decline was observed from 13,000 pairs in 1970 to 1,500 in 1992. A very high decline of 99–100%, followed the improvement of marginal grasslands in northern England. Low water levels shorten the period of food availability in pastures, due to the lower penetrability of soil, and thereby strongly influence the length of breeding season. Careful manipulation of water levels may allow improvement of breeding success (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).
B177;Gallinago_media;"This species's nesting habitats include floodplain and tussock meadows, natural fens with scattered bushes and peatlands up to 1,200 m (J. Ash in litt. 1999) in lowland interior taiga and wooded tundra (Cramp and Simmons 1983). In the Scandinavian mountains it breeds along the tree line. It shows a preference for habitats rich in sub-surface invertebrates and medium density scrub cover for nesting, often in wide river valleys (Van Gils et al. 2013). It is also tolerant of wooded and on occasion well-drained sites that adjoin bogs or marshes (Cramp and Simmons 1983). On migration it occurs in drier meadows but also on sedge marshes with Common Snipe (Gallinago gallinago).

It breeds from mid-May to early-July and nests solitarily. It has a polygamous mating system, with males forming leks after sunset (Van Gils et al. 2013) from May to July and each lek holding 5–30 males (Johnsgard 1981). The nest is a shallow depression in the ground, filled with some moss or grass, in thick vegetation, usually completely concealed, but sometimes more open. Clutches are normally four eggs. Its diet consists predominantly of earthworms as well as gastropods, adult and larval terrestrial insects (beetles, tipulids), and the seeds of marsh plants. This species is migratory, however, some birds irregularly winter in north-west Europe and southern Scandinavia. It departs from its breeding grounds from early-August onwards and the return, northward migration occurs on a broad front across Africa between March and April (Van Gils et al. 2013).";;Rapid declines in the southern forest and forest-steppe zones of Russia and Ukraine are largely a result of the destruction and deterioration of nesting habitats. The main causes of habitat loss are conversion to intensive agriculture (Kålås et al. 1997), wetland drainage and the submergence of river valleys during the creation of reservoirs. It is also hunted in eastern Europe (Kålås 2004), with reports of several thousand killed in just 15-20 days in Amasia, Armenia (L. Balyan in litt. 2008). Habitat loss due to climate change may represent the most severe threat to the Scandinavian population (R. Ekblom in litt. 2007, J. A. Kålås in litt. 2007).
B176;Gallinago_stenura;This species is fully migratory and travels over land on a broad front between its breeding and wintering grounds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It breeds from late-May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) after which it migrates in small flocks of 5–10 individuals (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species also overwinters in small groups (Johnsgard 1981). It breeds in Arctic and boreal wetlands up to 2,300 m above sea-level on damp meadows along river valleys (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), in grassy and mossy swamps (Flint et al. 1984), swampy taiga forest (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984), sphagnum bogs (Johnsgard 1981) and shrub tundra with patches of dwarf birch (Betula nana) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In its wintering range the species inhabits a wider variety of wetland habitats including flooded paddy-fields, wet grasslands, seepage swamps and marshland (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), often foraging on the muddy shorelines of swamps and along streams (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Its diet consists of molluscs, adult and larval insects, earthworms and occasionally crustaceans, seeds and other plant matter. The nest is a shallow depression usually well-concealed in dense cover (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;;The species is subject to hunting pressures throughout its range (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).
B180;Limosa_lapponica;The species breeds in marshy, swampy areas, in lowland moss and shrub tundra (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) near wet river valleys (Johnsgard 1981), lakes and sedge bogs (Flint et al. 1984), as well as on swampy heathlands in the willow and birch zone near the Arctic treeline (Johnsgard 1981), in open larch Larix spp. woodland close to water (Van Gils and Wiersma), and occasionally on open bogs in the extreme north of the coniferous forest zone (Johnsgard 1981). On passage the species may frequent inland wetlands (Hayman et al. 1986), sandy beaches with pine Pinus spp. stands, swampy lowlands near lakes (Flint et al. 1984) and short-grass meadows, but during the winter it is more common in intertidal areas along muddy coastlines, estuaries, inlets, mangrove-fringed lagoons and sheltered bays (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) with tidal mudflats or sandbars (Johnsgard 1981). It breeds from late-May to August (Hayman et al. 1986). The nest is a depression positioned on a dry elevated site often between clumps of grass (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) or under a thicket (Flint et al. 1984). When breeding the species feeds on insects, annelid worms, molluscs and occasionally seeds and berries. At other times in intertidal areas the species's diet consists of annelids, bivalves and crustaceans, although it will also take cranefly larvae and earthworms on grasslands and occasionally larval amphibians and small fish.  This species is a full long-distance migrant (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). After breeding adults disperse to coastal moulting sites, then onwards to their wintering grounds. Birds breeding in Europe mainly winter in western Europe. Birds from the east only use wetlands in western Europe as stop-over sites on their way to Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;The species is vulnerable due to concentration at a few wetlands in the non-breeding season (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is threatened by the degradation of foraging sites due to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Kelin and Qiang 2006) and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B179;Limosa_limosa;In its breeding range this species mostly inhabits areas with high grass and soft soil (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils et al. 2014). Its preferred habitats include cattle pastures, hayfields (Johnsgard 1981), lowland wet grasslands, grassy marshland, raised bogs and moorland, lake margins and damp grassy depressions in steppes (Van Gils et al. 2014). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding populations in western European. In its non-breeding range, it inhabits wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp et al. 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994). Subspecies limosa tends to winter in freshwater habitats. Subspecies islandica, while it frequents staging sites at inland wetlands and flooded grasslands in the Netherlands, it often winters in brackish habitats (Van Gils et al. 2014). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between populations of subspecies limosa and islandica (Various 2007). It breeds from April to mid-June in loose, semi-colonial groups (Gunnarsson et al. 2006). The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxuriant vegetation (Johnsgard 1981, Cramp et al. 1983, Van Gils et al. 2014). It consists of a shallow scrape 12–15 cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp et al. 1983). Clutch size is normally four (Van Gils et al. 2014). Its diet consists of adult and larval insects, annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils et al. 2014). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains (Cramp et al. 1983, Van Gils et al. 2014). This species is highly gregarious and migrates on a broad front, making long-distance flights, often overland between relatively few staging and wintering areas. The species migrates southwards between late-June and October (Van Gils et al. 2014). The eastern Atlantic flyway population has important staging areas on the Iberian peninsula and winters in western Africa.;;Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely, abandonment, are the most significant threats (Kentie et al. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land, increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland (Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), artificial flooding of nesting habitats, earlier and more frequent mowing as farmers adapt to earlier springs, spring burning, overgrowing by scrub, land claiming by businesses and developers, the construction of roads and parks, and disturbance by walkers (Tucker and Heath 1994, A. van Dijk in litt. 2005,  A. Mischenko in litt. 2007, Hayhow 2008, Oomen 2008, Holm and Laursen 2009, Kleijn et al. 2010, Kentie et al. 2013). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman et al. 2009). In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to sillage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007). Habitat fragmentation may cause particular problems for this species, which nests in dispersed colonies and sub-colonies as protection against predators and may be unlikely to breed successfully in small areas of habitat. The planned development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill et al. 2007, Masero et al. 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the EU in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield in litt. 2008) which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact are unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species's range (H. Hötker in litt. 2005), and drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994). The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestation of the lowland habitats where they breed (S. Nagy in litt. 2005). Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture and urban expansion. A study in the Netherlands suggests that climate change has driven an advance in agricultural activities to the detriment of this species (Kleijn et al. 2010). Juvenile birds which select good wintering sites also select good breeding sites (Gunnarsson et al. 2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds and slowing the rate of decline. There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande et al. 1980, Reijnen et al. 1996). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk et al. 1998). A recent study shows that recruiters from good quality habitats disperse to low quality habitats that act as sinks and so these individuals are considered 'lost' to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie 2015).
B175;Lymnocryptes_minimus;This species is fully migratory and crosses Europe on a broad front. It breeds from May to early September (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) in well-dispersed solitary pairs (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), after which (between August and September) adults undergo a flightless moulting period close to the breeding grounds. The autumn south-west migration occurs from mid-September to mid-November, with the species departing its wintering grounds again in March to mid-April. Outside of the breeding season the species remains largely solitary, usually feeding singly or in groups of up to five individuals. Most of its activities are carried out nocturnally or in the early morning and late evening (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species breeds in the northern taiga and forest tundra zones on open grassy marshes and bogs with swampy ground (Johnsgard 1981, (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996)) on flood-plains (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996)), in swampy coniferous forest, willow (Salix spp.) marshes or wet alder (Alnus spp.) woods (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season it inhabits both fresh and brackish wetlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) showing a preference for mosaics of moist and waterlogged mudflats with soft, silty mud and dense of tussocks vegetation (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Suitable habitats include swamps, fens (Snow and Perrins 1998), grassy marshes (Johnsgard 1981), the margins of rivers and streams (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), overgrown flood-lands, sewage farms (Snow and Perrins 1998), rice-fields (Johnsgard 1981), flooded arable fields, damp pastures and water meadows (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists of adult and larval insects, annelid worms, small freshwater and terrestrial gastropods and the seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic and shoreline plants (Johnsgard 1981). The nest is positioned on hummocks of sphagnum moss or grass tussocks on floating bogs just above the surrounding water (Johnsgard 1981), also on drier ground amongst bushes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g., dwarf birch (Betula nana) and heather) (Johnsgard 1981).;;The species is threatened by the loss and degradation of its wetland habitats through afforestation, peat extraction and drainage for agricultural intensification (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It also suffers from lead poisoning as a result of ingesting lead shot deposited on wetlands (Olivier 2006). The species is hunted during the autumn migration (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. in Denmark) (Bregnballe et al. 2006).
B182;Numenius_arquata;This species frequents fens, peat bogs, heathland, coastal marshes, wet grasslands and large river valleys. In boreal Russia and Fennoscandia it prefers tundra and in areas such as France, the Netherlands and the U.K. it has successfully colonised pastures and other agricultural grasslands. European wintering birds mostly gather at large estuaries and other extensive muddy sites (Tucker and Heath 1994). It also utilises wet grassland and arable fields during migration (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Most populations breed from April to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary, territorial pairs (Johnsgard 1981), occasionally also forming small colonies (Flint et al. 1984). The nest is a shallow depression on the ground or on a mound (Flint et al. 1984) in the open or in the cover of grass or sedge (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) often far from water (Johnsgard 1981). Clutch size is typically four. Throughout the year the diet includes annelids, arthropods, crustaceans, molluscs, berries and seeds. Vertebrates, including small fish, amphibians, lizards, young birds and small rodents as well as terrestrial insects and earthworms are also consumed, especially in summer (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species is migratory and European populations overwinter in Western Europe, the Mediterranean and in many parts of Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). After breeding adults gather on coasts (from July onwards) (Hayman et al. 1986) for the post-breeding moult (Snow and Perrins 1998) before migrating south between July and November. Non-breeders may remain in the wintering areas all-year-round (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;;The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of moorland habitats as a result of afforestation (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and of marginal grassland habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and improvement (Johnsgard 1981, Baines 1988, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. drainage, inorganic fertilisation and reseeding) (Baines 1988). The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities (due to mechanical mowing) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Wintering populations are threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Burton et al. 2002a, 2002b) (e.g. from construction work (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic (Burton et al. 2002b)), development on high-tide roosting sites, pollution (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and the flooding of estuarine mudflats and saltmarshes as a result of tidal barrage construction (Burton 2006). The species is also threatened by the degradation of migrational staging areas owing to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). Local populations of this species have also declined owing to hunting pressures (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).
B181;Numenius_phaeopus;This species is fully migratory and travels over land on a broad front utilising few staging areas on route (in autumn no known concentrated staging occurs) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) either in well-dispersed (Johnsgard 1981) solitary pairs (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) or in loose groups depending on the topography of the land (Snow and Perrins 1998). The autumn migration occurs from July onwards with the return passage to the breeding grounds occurring chiefly between March and May (Hayman et al. 1986). The species breeds on dry scrub heathland (Snow and Perrins 1998), moss and lichen tundra with stunted bushes, sedge meadows (Johnsgard 1981), wet moorland (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and mossy hummock bogs (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984) in open areas, river valleys, in birch forest near the Arctic treeline (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), along the shores of tundra lakes, burned areas of forest (Flint et al. 1984) and open montane forest in the boreal, subarctic and subalpine zones. On passage in the autumn and spring the species frequents wetlands, tidal flats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), short-sward wet and dry grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), farmland (Hayman et al. 1986) and heathland with Empetrum spp., generally occupying coastal habitats in the winter such as muddy, rocky or sandy beaches, tidal mudflats (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), sandflats (Urban et al. 1986), tidal marshes (Johnsgard 1981) and lagoons (Urban et al. 1986). When inland on migration and during the breeding season its diet consists of adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera, Orthoptera and cranefly larvae), spiders, millipedes, earthworms, snails, slugs, seeds, leaves and berries (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. of ericaceous plants) (Johnsgard 1981). On the coast during the winter the species takes crustaceans, molluscs, large polychaete worms and occasionally fish, reptiles or young birds. The nest is a shallow depression (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) often positioned on hummocks or in short heather or grass in dry exposed locations sometimes far from water (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984). When the breeding habitat (e.g. tundra or heathland) is flat and open the species nests in solitary pairs, but where irregular features such as hummocks and tall vegetation patches give more visual isolation the species may nest in loose groups (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B202;Phalaropus_fulicarius;This species?s range includes the coasts of Arctic Ocean, in West Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard. It winters pelagically mainly off western Africa. It breeds near the coast, on marshy tundra with small pools, boggy meadows with moss and grass, marshy river valleys or islets in fjords. Outside of the breeding season it is pelagic in tropical and subtropical upwelling zones where plankton occurs at high concentrations. During breeding season it feeds on invertebrates, including insects and their larvae, such as dipteran flies, caddisflies, beetles and bugs, also molluscs, crustaceans, annelids, spiders and mites, and occasionally plant material, mainly seeds, especially when food is limited. it feeds in or around small pools or lagoons or on Fucus seaweed washed ashore. It is also often at sea and forages by swimming, wading and walking, and quickly lunges forward at prey (Van Gils et al. 1996).;;Changes to habitat in the Arctic and sub-Arctic are likely to impact this species during its breeding season. At sea, this species is likely to be vulnerable to being caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries (?ydelis et al. 2013). The species relies on predator alarm warning from breeding Arctic Terns, and localised populations have decreased rapidly from some breeding colonies in Greenland in the absence of Arctic Terns (Jorgensen et al. 2007).
B201;Phalaropus_lobatus;"The species breeds from the coast to interior of Arctic on tundra, forest tundra and Scandinavian alpine tundra, at or near lakes and pools with marshy margins, often overgrown with grass, sedges and moss; sparsely vegetated lava deserts in Iceland; coastal moorland; often in floodplains of large rivers or on islets; also Polygonum bogs (Van Gils et al. 2014). During migration, the species uses inland saline and hypersaline lakes. It winters at sea, in upwelling zones and ocean slicks with high availability of plankton. During the breeding season it feeds chiefly on insects, as well as beetles, caddisflies, ants and bugs; also other small invertebrates, and some seeds. On saline lakes it feeds on brine-flies (Ephydra), mostly larval. During its pelagic non-breeding period, it feeds mainly on euphausiids and calanoid copepods. It forages by swimming, wading and walking, pecking at prey at the water surface, from vegetation or mud, or rapidly lunges at prey just below water surface (Van Gils et al. 2014)";;The species faces ongoing changes to habitat caused by increasing temperatures and impact of climate change (Huntley et al. 2007). Habitat destruction, including from peat extraction could also impact the species during its breeding stage. Coastal dredging could also reduce available habitat and prey while at sea (O'Brien et al. 1997). It is vulnerable to invasive alien predators (Biodiversity in Sweden 2012), as well as human disturbance on its breeding grounds.
B174;Scolopax_rusticola;The species is sedentary on Atlantic islands (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and in some areas in south-western maritime countries (Snow and Perrins 1998) but is otherwise strongly migratory (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The distribution of earthworms is an important habitat characteristic for the species throughout the year (Johnsgard 1981). For breeding the species requires extensive unfragmented areas (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) of broadleaved deciduous or mixed broadleaved/coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1981) containing a dense undergrowth of shrubs and ground cover (Lutz and Pagh Jensen 2005) (e.g. of brambles (Rubus spp.), holly (Ilex aquifolium), hazel (Corylus avellana), gorse (Ulex spp.), bracken (Pteridium spp.) or bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus)) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Lutz and Pagh Jensen 2005) and with a mosaic (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) of dry, warm resting places, moist areas for foraging (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986) (e.g. streams, springs or damp, swampy patches) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and clearings or other open areas as flight paths (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986). The species may also nest in swampy forests with mossy ground, brooks and other watercourses or alternatively in coniferous forest with moist leaf litter and an undergrowth of broadleaved shrubs and ferns (Johnsgard 1981). The species's habitats requirements during the daylight hours of the non-breeding season are similar to its breeding habitat requirements but are less restricted (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). As well as extensive broadleaved or mixed broadleaved/coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1981) the species will also occupy young conifer plantations (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), hedges with high densities of trees and shrubs (Duriez et al. 2005b), smaller woods, areas of scrub (Hayman et al. 1986) and coppiced habitats with coppice that is 7–20 years old (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It still shows a strong preference for woodlands with rich (e.g. mull) humus types that have high earthworm biomasses, and a dense shrub strata however (Duriez et al. 2005b). At night during this season the species gathers to roost and feed in damp, earthworm-rich, permanent grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Duriez et al. 2005b), showing a preference for grazed meadows compared to cultivated fields (as the latter contain higher earthworm biomasses) (Duriez et al. 2005b). The species may also feed on intertidal mud during freezing weather (Hayman et al. 1986). Its diet consists predominantly of earthworms, especially during the non-breeding season (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), but the species may also take adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, earwigs and millipedes), spiders, slugs and leaches.;;The most significant threat to the species in its breeding range is the increased fragmentation of woodlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Outside of the breeding season the species is threatened by the disappearance of permanent grasslands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and through the intensification of agricultural practices (e.g. the destruction of hedges, decreases in the number of permanent grazed meadows and the impoverishment of soil fauna as a result of ploughing and chemical application) (Duriez et al. 2005b). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (both in its breeding and wintering range) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is widely hunted, with the largest numbers taken in France, Italy, U.K. and Spain.
B183;Tringa_erythropus;This species is a full migrant (Hayman et al. 1986, Smit and Piersma 1989, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), breeding in the subarctic and arctic zone of Fennoscandia and Siberia (Smit and Piersma 1989). On passage to its wintering grounds the majority of the species travels overland on a broad front, although there is also an important route down the west coast of Europe (Smit and Piersma 1989, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During the breeding season this species inhabits lowland and upland (but not montane) regions, in wooded and open tundra (Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes, swampy pine or birch forest near the arctic tree-line, and also more open areas such as heathland and shrub tundra (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During migration and on its wintering grounds (Flint et al. 1984) this species frequents a variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands such as sewage farms, irrigated rice fields, brackish lagoons, salt-marshes, salt-pans, sheltered muddy coastal shores (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), marshes and marshy lake edges (Johnsgard 1981, Urban et al. 1986), small reservoirs, pools and flooded grasslands (Urban et al. 1986). The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting chiefly of aquatic insects and their larvae (especially swimming beetles and hemipterans), terrestrial flying insects (such as craneflies), small crustaceans, molluscs, polycheate worms, and small fish and amphibians (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest of this species is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998) positioned in grass tussocks (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), on sphagnum moss (Flint et al. 1984), or in fairly dry areas of forest amongst low vegetation such as dwarf willows (Johnsgard 1981). Nest sites are often selected near dead trees or other suitable look-out perches (Johnsgard 1981).;;This species is threatened by habitat loss in its wintering range and on migration.
B188;Tringa_glareola;This species is a full migrant, traveling overland on a broad front across Europe and the Middle East (Van Gils et al. 2013). The adults start to move away from the breeding grounds in late June, with juveniles following in late August, arriving in tropical Africa from late July through August to October. Spring departure from the wintering grounds begins in late March to early April, with breeding areas starting to be reoccupied from late April (early June in northern Russia) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and with breeding occurring between May and mid July (Van Gils et al. 2013). Some non-breeding birds may also remain in the south throughout the summer (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the breeding season this species inhabits open, swampy areas in boreal forest (Van Gils et al. 2013), scrubland between tundra and coniferous forest with willow, dwarf birch or spruce, wet heathlands, and extensive mossy, sedgy or grassy marshes (Snow and Perrins 1998). Whilst on the breeding grounds this species is chiefly carnivorous, taking small insects, especially the aquatic forms such as dytiscid or hydrophilid beetles, Hemiptera and the larvae of Diptera such as midges (Johnsgard 1981). The nest is a scrape on the ground amongst dense vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998, Van Gils et al. 2013) or raised on a tussock or slight ridge, and can sometimes be surrounded by water (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also nest in trees in the abandoned nests of other species (Van Gils et al. 2013) such as thrushes (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The species is threatened in some European countries (such as Finland) from exploitation, and peatland drainage and destruction for forestry and agriculture (Van Gils et al. 2013). The populations in southern Sweden, Germany and Poland have also declined, possibly due to the threats of climatic change (Van Gils et al. 2013). The species is susceptible to both avian botulism (Hubalek et al. 2005) and avian malaria (Mendes et al. 2005), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.
B186;Tringa_nebularia;This species is fully migratory and generally migrates overland on a broad front, although the majority of western European birds pass through coastal and estuarine sites (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The Wadden Sea for example is used by many Fennoscandian birds as a stop-over and moulting site from late April to mid-May. Most Palearctic birds are trans-Saharan migrants (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), the main autumn passage through northern and temperate Europe occurring from the second week of July to late October (Snow and Perrins 1998). Flocks arrive in southern Africa and Australia from August to September, and depart again in March for the northward return migration (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species breeds in the boreal forest zone from sea level to 1,200 m in Norway (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998) (although predominantly up to 450 m) (Snow and Perrins 1998), in swampy forest clearings, woody moorland, open bogs and marshes (including raised and blanket bogs) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and eutrophic lakes with margins of dead and decaying vegetation (Johnsgard 1981). In its wintering grounds this species frequents a variety of freshwater, marine and artificial wetlands, including swamps, open muddy or rocky shores of lakes and large rivers, sewage farms, saltworks, inundated rice-fields (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), ponds, reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998), saltmarshes, sandy or muddy coastal flats, estuaries (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) or lagoons and pools on tidal reefs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On migration this species occurs on inland flooded meadows, dried-up lakes, sandbars and marshes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species is chiefly carnivorous, its diet consisting of insects and their larvae (especially beetles), crustaceans, annelids, molluscs, amphibians (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), small fish (mullet Liza spp., clinids Clinus spp. and tilapia Oreochromis spp.) (Hockey et al. 2005) and occasionally rodents (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is a shallow scrape on open ground, often in clearings in woods (Snow and Perrins 1998), and is typically placed next to a piece of dead wood (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), or beside rocks, trees (Johnsgard 1981), fences and sticks (for use as nest markers) (Snow and Perrins 1998).; It avoids bare or broken barren expanses, mountain escarpments, and closed forests with very dense, tall vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998).;The species has suffered in some areas from habitat degradation caused by off-road vehicles or dry conditions causing vegetation to become rank (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B187;Tringa_ochropus;"This species is fully migratory and moves overland on a broad front (Urban et al. 1986) with European populations making well-documented stop-overs in Saharan oases (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). During the breeding season this species inhabits damp areas in swampy, old pine, spruce or alder woodland and montane forest with many fallen and rotten tree stumps, marshy forest floors and heavy carpets of lichens and mosses, generally in the vicinity of rivers, streams, swamps, ponds, lakes (Johnsgard 1981) and bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season this species shows a preference for a wider variety of inland freshwater habitats such as marshes, lake edges, sewage farms, small dams and ponds, ditches, riverbanks and forest streams, often near villages and cultivation (Urban et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996)  The species is omnivorous, although its diet is predominantly made up of aquatic and terrestrial insects (Snow and Perrins 1998) (e.g. dragonfly larvae, ants, waterbugs, moth larvae, and the adults and larvae of beetles, Diptera and Trichoptera), annelids, small crustaceans, spiders and fish, as well as plant fragments (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).

This species frequently nests high in trees in the abandoned nests of passerine species such as Common Woodpigeon (Columba palumbus), thrushes (Turdus spp.) (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), crows, jays and shrikes (Johnsgard 1981), but may also nest in squirrel dreys (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), on natural platforms up to 20 m high (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), and occasionally on tree stumps or mounds of accumulated pine needles, among branches and tree roots, or amongst fallen trees on the ground (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998).";(although less often in the vicinity of woodland) (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It is also very rarely found in intertidal areas such as creeks and the channels of saltmarshes (Johnsgard 1981, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;This species is susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B185;Tringa_stagnatilis;This species inhabits warm inland wetlands from open steppe to boreal forest, including shallow freshwater and brackish marshlands, grassy or marshy lake-edges (Johnsgard 1981), river valleys, flooded meadows (Snow and Perrins 1998) and occasionally salt-lakes (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). Outside of the breeding season the species typically occurs on the margins of inland freshwater and brackish wetlands such as rice paddy-fields, swamps, salt-pans, salt-marshes, sewage works and marshy lake-edges. It occupies its breeding areas by mid-April to mid-May (Snow and Perrins 1998). It usually nests solitarily or in loose colonies with pairs spaced less than 10 m apart (Hayman et al. 1986). The nest of this species is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998), often on a mound at the marshy edge of a lagoon, lake or pool (Johnsgard 1981). Clutches are typically four eggs. This species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of small fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and both aquatic and terrestrial insects (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). This species is a full migrant, travelling overland on a broad front to winter in the Mediterranean and sub-Saharan Africa through the Persian Gulf and southern Asia to Indonesia and Australia.  The main passage to and from Russia is believed to occur east of the Black Sea (Snow and Perrins 1998), with only a few birds crossing Europe (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;, and although it is rare on open coastlines it can occasionally be found on estuaries, lagoons and intertidal mudflats (Urban et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Hockey et al. 2005);The species has disappeared as a breeding bird from eastern Europe, Belarus, Moldova and Russia as a result of steppe habitat losses due to agricultural intensification (such as increased ploughing (Tomkovich 1992)), and possibly also due to egg-collecting (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It may be susceptible to future outbreaks of avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974), partly due to its choice of habitat (it often shows a preference for sewage works) (Hockey et al. 2005).
B184;Tringa_totanus;Most populations of this species are fully migratory and travel on a broad front over land and along coasts, some Icelandic and western European populations remaining close to their breeding grounds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). It breeds from March to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs or in loose colonies (Hayman et al. 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), departing the breeding grounds from June to October, and returning from the wintering grounds again between February and April (Hayman et al. 1986). The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, inland wet grasslands with short swards (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (including cultivated meadows) (Johnsgard 1981), grassy marshes, swampy heathlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and swampy moors (Johnsgard 1981). On passage the species may frequent inland flooded grasslands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and the silty shores of rivers and lakes (Flint et al. 1984), but during the winter it is largely coastal, occupying rocky, muddy and sandy beaches, saltmarshes, tidal mudflats, saline and freshwater coastal lagoons (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), tidal estuaries (Johnsgard 1981), saltworks and sewage farms. When breeding it feeds on insects, spiders and annelid worms. During the non-breeding season the species takes insects, spiders and annelid worms, as well as molluscs, crustaceans (especially amphipods e.g. Corophium spp.) and occasionally small fish and tadpoles (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The nest is a shallow scrape or hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) on a hummock or at the base of a tuft (Flint et al. 1984) of grass, often well hidden by overhanging leaves (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species usually nests solitarily inland (less than 10 pairs/km2) but in loosely colonial groups (up to 100–300 pairs/km2) on the coast (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;;The species is threatened by the loss of breeding and wintering habitats through agricultural intensification, wetland drainage, flood control, afforestation, land reclamation, industrial development (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), encroachment of Spartina spp. on mudflats (Evans 1986, Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), improvement of marginal grasslands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) (e.g. by drainage, inorganic fertilising and re-seeding) (Baines 1988), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), and heavy grazing (e.g., of saltmarshes) (Norris et al. 1998). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (U.K.) (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton et al. 2002b). It is vulnerable to severe cold periods on its western European wintering grounds (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996) and suffers from nest predation by introduced predators (e.g. European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus)) on some islands (Jackson 2001). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B189;Xenus_cinereus;This species breeds in lowland valleys in northern boreal forest and tundra, especially on floodplains with flooded meadows and marshes, and where overgrown moist grasslands alternate with willow scrub (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It also frequents lakesides and marshy banks of streams, and extends to the coasts of sheltered seas in the Baltic. During migration the species may stop-over at inland freshwater wetlands (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), such as muddy lakes or river edges (Urban et al. 1986). Breeding occurs between May and June and is semi-colonial (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996), but the species is mainly solitary outside of the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a shallow depression close to water either in the open, or sheltered by short grasses (Urban et al. 1986). Clutch size is normally four eggs. On its breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of adult and larval midges (Diptera) as well as seeds. On migration the diet of this species is more varied, consisting of a variety of insects, small molluscs, crustaceans (including crabs), spiders and annelid worms. This species is a full migrant, moving south from late July to August. The Finnish population flies across eastern Europe and crosses the Mediterranean and Sahara non-stop (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).;The species avoids mountains, fast rocky streams, steep or broken terrain, extensive open spaces and tall dense forest (Snow and Perrins 1998). ;The breeding success of this species is not well known, but there are indications that an overall increase of common gulls, crows and mammalian predators has led to increased nest predation. Anthropogenic habitats in the wood processing industry are subject to unpredictable changes that can drive small range populations to extinction within a short period of time. Historically there are indications of illegal egg collection at the breeding sites (HELCOM 2012).
B203;Stercorarius_skua;"This marine species avoids land during migration and winter, aggregating in winter in areas where it can scavenge from fisheries. It breeds on islands, favours flat ground with some vegetation cover, but less than 20 cm tall. Breeding begins in May and it is loosely colonial but highly territorial. The nest is a scrape typically lined with dead grass. Clutches are normally two eggs, but inexperienced birds may only lay one. It has a hugely varied diet owing to being a highly opportunistic feeder. Individuals regularly show individual specialisations in diet and feeding with some colony-specific learning. The species is migratory; wintering mostly off the coast of Iberia but younger birds will travel further (Furness 1996).";usually avoiding areas frequented by humans and ;Declines in Shetland have been due to a recent reduction in sand eel stocks that have resulted in reduced breeding success and less birds at the largest colonies. Changes in fishing practices could also have serious impacts as more than half the summer diet at Shetland is made up of discards from fisheries (Furness 1996) and when discard rates are reduced this species will switch to predating other birds, especially if small shoaling pelagic fish are scarce (Votier et al. 2004). Fishing activities also pose a threat through drowning in fishing nets or being caught on hooks. Human persecution (often illegal) has limited the size of some colonies although harvesting for food has now nearly ceased (Furness 1996). The species is also affected by climate change (Oswald et al. 2008).
B206;Stercorarius_longicaudus;This species is marine and highly pelagic, rarely occurring within sight of land except when breeding. It feeds mainly on lemmings during the summer but will also take shrews, many insects, berries and small birds when microtines are scarce. Its winter diet is largely unknown, but probably includes marine insects and fish with some scavenging and kleptoparasitism. Breeding begins in June with birds widely scattered over the Arctic and subarctic or montane tundra, up to 1,300 m in Scandinavia. It is highly territorial. The nest is an unlined, inconspicuous scrape into which two eggs are typically laid. It is a transequatorial migrant but due to its pelagic nature its migration routes and winter distribution are poorly known (Furness et al. 2013).;;This species suffers heavy predation of eggs and young from Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). Its breeding success is closely linked with lemming abundance (Furness et al. 2013) and thus is threatened by possible disruption to lemming cycles caused by climate change. This may already be a threat as recent anomalies in lemming cycle dynamics in eastern Greenland have already been observed (Gilg et al. 2009).
B205;Stercorarius_parasiticus;This species is marine and predominately coastal but will migrate over land. It breeds on tundra, moorland or grassland.  Breeding begins in May or June, occurring later in the north than the south. It is either colonial at seabird sites or widely scattered across the tundra where it is territorial. The nest is an unlined scrape and is inconspicuous. Clutches are normally two eggs, but inexperienced birds may only lay one. Most or all of its food will be obtained by kleptoparasitism when nesting near other seabird colonies, otherwise its diet can include microtine rodents, adult and fledgling passerines, wader chicks, birds' eggs, insects and berries. The species is mainly a transequatorial migrant, with very small numbers wintering in Northern Hemisphere (Furness 1996).;;Human persecution is a very local problem in Scotland, Faeroes, Iceland and Scandinavia. Increasing numbers of Catharacta skua have displaced some colonies in Scotland. Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) is a major predator of eggs and chicks at higher latitudes, and Snowy Owls (Nyctea scandiaca) can also take many chicks (Furness 1996). In some areas the species is also threatened by wind energy production (Furness et al. 2013), fisheries (Furness 2002) and rising temperature extremes (Furness 2007).
B204;Stercorarius_pomarinus;This species is marine outside the breeding season, remaining somewhat coastal, especially in upwelling regions of the tropics and subtropics.  It breeds on Arctic tundra, favouring low-lying moss tundra with pools, and hummocky areas in moist bogs. Breeding begins in June at scattered sites across the tundra where lemming concentrations are high. Individuals are highly territorial. The nest is an unlined scrape and is inconspicuous. Clutches are normally two eggs. Whilst breeding it specialises on catching lemmings which frequently constitute over 90% of their diet, also feeding on young waders and gamebirds, bird eggs and carrion. In winter it takes fish, sometimes by kleptoparasitism, small seabirds, and scavenges on carrion. Outside the breeding season, it migrates south, including long migrations over land (Furness 1996).;;The breeding success of this species is dependent on lemming abundance. Predation of eggs and chicks by Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) and Snowy Owls (Nyctea scandiaca) occurs but is not a serious threat as this species is large enough to drive off nest predators (Furness 1996).
B141;Turnix_sylvaticus;"The species was formerly found in coastal scrub of bushes and dwarf palms (palmetto) Chaemerops humilis (Arecaceae), but now probably confined to suboptimal Mediterranean coastal sand scrub community including Halimium halimifolium (Cistaceae), Pistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae) and Quercus suber (Fagaceae) (Madge and McGowan 2002), as well as broom Calicotome villosa (Fabaceae) scrub and adjacent cultivated areas (Gutiérrez Exposito et al. 2011, Debus and Kirwan 2013). It breeds April to August (Debus and Kirwan 2013). The nest is a shallow, well-concealed scrape lined with grass, under grass tussock or low vegetation; standing grass stems often pulled over to form a loose canopy (Debus and Kirwan 2013). It usually lays four eggs (Madge and McGowan 2002). It feeds on seeds and invertebrates in about equal proportions (Madge and McGowan 2002). It is apparently sedentary in the western Palearctic (Debus and Kirwan 2013).";;Over the past half century much of the habitat in the sandy areas of its range has been lost to irrigated agriculture or forestry. An unknown number are mistakenly shot each year by quail hunters. In some areas it may have been affected by overabundance of opportunistic predators such as foxes and wild boar (Madroño et al. 2004).
B40;Ciconia_ciconia;This is a large charismatic species with close associations to human culture, and is a flagship species for conservation. This species is a Palearctic migrant (Elliott et al. 2014) that travels with the assistance of thermal updrafts, the occurrence of which restricts the migratory routes the species can take (Hancock et al. 1992). It breeds from February to April in the Palearctic (Elliott et al. 2014). It nests in loose colonies of up to 30 pairs (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014) or solitarily (Elliott et al. 2014). The main departure from the European breeding grounds occurs in August (Hancock et al. 1992) with the species travelling in large flocks (Brown et al. 1982, Hancock et al. 1992), generally arriving in Africa by early October (Brown et al. 1982). The species inhabits open areas, shallow marshes, lakesides (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014), lagoons (Elliott et al. 2014), flood-plains, rice-fields and arable land (Snow and Perrins 1998) especially where there are scattered trees for roosting (Elliott et al. 2014).  During the winter the species shows a preference for drier habitats (Hancock et al. 1992) such as grasslands, steppe and cultivated fields (Elliott et al. 2014), often gathering near lakes, ponds (Hancock et al. 1992), pools, slow-flowing streams, ditches (Elliott et al. 2014) or rivers (Hancock et al. 1992). The species is carnivorous and has a varied and opportunistic diet. It takes small mammals (Elliott et al. 2014) (e.g., voles, water voles, mice, shrews, young rats (Hancock et al. 1992)), large insects (e.g. beetles, grasshoppers, crickets and locusts), adult and juvenile amphibians, snakes, lizards, earthworms, fish (Elliott et al. 2014), eggs and nestlings of ground-nesting birds, molluscs and crustaceans (Hancock et al. 1992). The nest is constructed of sticks (Elliott et al. 2014) and is commonly positioned up to 30 m above the ground (Brown et al. 1982) in trees or on the roofs of buildings, as well as on pylons, telegraph poles, stacks of straw and other anthropogenic sites (including specially erected nesting structures), cliffs and occasionally among rushes on the ground (Elliott et al. 2014). The species nests solitarily or in loose colonies, often using traditional nesting sites (there are records of individual nests being used every year for 100 years) (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014). Nesting sites are usually situated near foraging areas, but may be up to 2–3 km away (Snow and Perrins 1998).;It generally avoids regions with persistent cold, wet weather or large tracts of tall, dense vegetation such as reedbeds or forests (Hancock et al. 1992, Elliott et al. 2014).;The species is threatened by habitat alteration including the drainage of wet meadows (Goriup and Schulz 1990, Elliott et al. 2014), prevention of floods on flood-plains (by dams, embankments, pumping stations and river canalisation schemes) (Goriup and Schulz 1990), conversion of foraging areas (Elliott et al. 2014), development, industrialisation and intensification of agriculture (Hancock et al. 1992) (e.g. mechanised ploughing of rough pastures to sow fertilised crops or swards of more productive grass varieties) (Goriup and Schulz 1990). It is also threatened by a shortage of nesting sites in some areas (Elliott et al. 2014) as, for example, the roofs of new rural buildings do not support nests and nest structures on pylons are frequently destroyed during maintenance work (Goriup and Schulz 1990). The species may also suffer as a result of the excessive use of pesticides  (Elliott et al. 2014, Hockey et al. 2005) and through eating poisoned baits put out to catch large carnivores (Elliott et al. 2014). Another serious threat is collision with and electrocution from overhead powerlines (Bairlein 1991, Elliott et al. 2014), especially whilst on migration in Europe (Hancock et al. 1992). The species is hunted for food and sport (Elliott et al. 2014), mainly on migration (Hancock et al. 1992) and in its winter quarters (Goriup and Schulz 1990).
B39;Ciconia_nigra;Most populations of this species are fully migratory and travel on a narrow front (Elliott et al. 2014) along well-defined routes (Brown et al. 1982, Hancock et al. 1992). Some breeding populations (e.g. in Spain) are also sedentary (Elliott et al. 2014). The species is a solitary nester, the timing of breeding varying between populations but generally coinciding with spring in the Palearctic Region (Elliott et al. 2014). On migration the species may travel singly (Snow and Perrins 1998) or in small groups (Elliott et al. 2014) of up to 100 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998), and on its wintering grounds it is normally observed singly or in small groups of less than 30 individuals (Brown et al. 1982). The species inhabits old, undisturbed, open forests (Snow and Perrins 1998, Elliott et al. 2014) from sea-level up to mountainous regions (e.g. 2,000–2,500 m in altitude) (Hancock et al. 1992). It forages in shallow streams, pools, marshes (Elliott et al. 2014), swampy patches (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Hancock et al. 1992), flood-plains, pools in dry riverbeds (Hockey et al. 2005) and occasionally grasslands (Elliott et al. 2014) especially where there are stands of reeds or long grass (Brown et al. 1982). It is predominantly piscivorous although it may also take amphibians, insects, snails, crabs, small reptiles, mammals and birds. The nest is a large construction of sticks (Elliott et al. 2014) positioned between 4–25 m high (Hancock et al. 1992) in large forest trees (Lohmus and Sellis 2003, Elliott et al. 2014) or on cliffs (Spain) (Elliott et al. 2014). The species shows a preference for nesting in trees that have canopies large enough to hold the nest away from the main trunk (e.g. trees 25 m high, 120 years old and with a diameter at breast height of 66 cm) (Lohmus and Sellis 2003). It nests solitarily, with pairs spread out in the landscape at a distance of no less than one kilometre (even where the species is most numerous) (Hancock et al. 1992). The species may occupy the nests of other bird species and commonly reuses nests in successive years (Elliott et al. 2014).;It generally avoids large bodies of water and dense forest (Elliott et al. 2014), but non-breeding birds may frequent the estuaries of tidal rivers (Hancock et al. 1992). ;"The main threat to this species is habitat degradation (Hancock et al. 1992, Balian et al. 2002, Lohmus and Sellis 2003, Diagana et al. 2006, Elliott et al. 2014). The area of suitable habitat available for breeding is being reduced in Russia and eastern Europe through deforestation (Elliott et al. 2014) (particularly the destruction of large traditional nesting trees) (Hancock et al. 1992, Lohmus and Sellis 2003), the rapid development of industry and farming (Hancock et al. 1992), the building of dams (Diagana et al. 2006) and lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002).

The species's wetland wintering habitats in Africa are further threatened by conversion (Elliott et al. 2014), agricultural intensification, desertification and pollution caused by the concentration of pesticides and other chemicals (Diagana et al. 2006, Elliott et al. 2014). The species is also occasionally killed by collisions with power-lines and overhead cables (Hockey et al. 2005), and hunting in southern Europe (especially during migration) has caused population declines (Hancock et al. 1992)."
B508;Columba_bollii;"The species typically inhabits areas of closed-canopy laurel forest (containing Lauraceae, Ericaceae and Rosaceae species, with Laurus azorica and Ocotea foetens particularly dominant) preferring ravines and passes (Tucker and Heath 1994, Baptista et al. 2013). It also uses heath vegetation consisting of Myrica faya and Erica arborea. It is sometimes found in open, degraded habitats including cultivated areas (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is typically present in the uplands.

It breeds between January and September with a peak in February-May. It lays one egg and may have two to three broods. The nest is made of sticks and is typically placed in the most abundant tree species:E. arborea, L. azorica, Ilex canariensis and M. faya. It feeds mainly on fruit but also takes grain, buds, leaves, shoots and invertebrates. It will feed on cabbages and other crops when berries are limited. The species is sedentary but moves to lower altitudes in late summer for feeding (Baptista et al. 2013).";;Historical declines resulted from intensive exploitation of laurel forests. The extent of forest loss has slowed, although fragmentation has continued in some areas as forests are exploited for poles and tool handles. A small amount of illegal hunting occurs at drinking sites. As it is a tree-nesting species, predation by introduced mammals including rats is of less significance than for C. junoniae but it remains a potential threat, the impact of which has not been fully assessed (Hernández et al. 1999). Grazing pressure from sheep is leading to habitat degradation on La Gomera and at El Hierro. Forest fires also pose a moderate threat to its habitat (BirdLife International 2010). Recreational activities cause some disturbance in the breeding season. The species is potentially threatened by outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Tuberculosis (BirdLife International 2010).
B509;Columba_junoniae;This species prefers thermophilous forest, with a potential altitudinal range of 200–500 m Asl on the north slopes of the islands, and 600–1,000 m in the south (Nogales et al. 2009) and occurs in areas with steep slopes, escarpments and gullies, as well as in laurel forest and Canary pine forest, and cultivated areas (Martín et al. 2000). The breeding season varies between islands, but extends from January to September, with a peak between April-June. At least on Tenerife, breeding success appears to be low, as a consequence of intense nest predation (Hernández et al. 1999, Martín et al. 2000). Nests are on the ground (in fissures, holes or small ledges, at the bases of trees, and under rocks or fallen tree trunks) in steep, rocky, shady areas with abundant shrubby vegetation (Martín et al. 2000). Clutch is one, occasionally two eggs. It feeds mostly on fruit, buds, some grain and flowers. A large part of its diet is made up of fruits of Ocotea foetens and Persea indica. It forages both in trees and on the ground and locally also feeds in orchards. The species is sedentary but sometimes moves from upland forests to lowland agricultural areas to feed (Baptista et al. 1997).;;Habitat loss has been extensive. Dry and laurel forests have been intensively exploited since the 15th century, and some areas of remaining forest continue to be felled and fragmented owing to the demand for wooden stakes and poles for agriculture, particularly vine-growing (Martín et al. 2000, Hernández 2004). Grazing by livestock, notably sheep, is degrading habitat on El Hierro and La Gomera. Predation of eggs and chicks by rats, and of nesting adults by feral cats (Felis catus), are important threats (Hernández 2004), particularly on Tenerife where five of seven nests monitored were predated, primarily by black rats (Rattus rattus) (Hernández et al. 1999, Martín et al. 2000). Illegal hunting remains a threat, especially when birds concentrate at drinking and feeding sites (Hernández 2004). Recreational activities such as climbing, abseiling, quad-biking, mountain-biking and motocross may disturb nesting birds (Hernández 2004, Barov and Derhé 2011). The species is potentially threatened by outbreaks of Newcastle Disease and Tuberculosis (Barov and Derhé 2011).
B244;Columba_livia;The species's natural habitat consists usually of rock faces, ledges in caves and sea cliffs where birds nest. The feral form is commensal with man and is particularly abundant in cities. Breeding season varies between regions. It breeds year round in the U.K. and Ireland with peak breeding in April. In the Mediterranean it breeds between March and July and in Cyprus from March to May. The nest is a cup loosely fashioned from stems, leaves, roots, driftwood, seaweed and feathers. It lays two eggs and may produce up to five broods each year. It typically feeds on grains but may also take some invertebrates. Natural populations are resident and sedentary (Baptista et al. 1997).;It avoids areas of tall and dense vegetation. ;"It is difficult to evaluate the conservation status and security of ""natural"" populations due to the confusion concerning the degree of mixing with feral birds. Natural populations are threatened by interbreeding with feral pigeons in many areas and pure populations are already confined to the remoter cliffs and islands, e.g. off north and west Scotland, but even here feral birds join the flocks (Baptista et al. 1997)."
B245;Columba_oenas;The species is found in generally fairly open country (Baptista et al. 1997). It uses woodland-edge habitat, parks and farmland with mature trees or other habitats offering suitable nest-hole sites (Tucker and Heath 1997). It mainly breeds between April and October, nesting in holes in old trees, rock crevices, rabbit burrows, buildings, old Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) nest holes and nest boxes. It may also nest in clumps of dense vegetation or under bushes. The nest is usually a twig platform but eggs may sometimes be laid on bare wood. It normally lays two eggs. It mostly feeds on the ground taking seeds, grain, green leaves, buds, flowers and some invertebrates (Baptista et al. 1997). It is wholly migratory in northern Europe and mainly resident in southern Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Baptista et al. 1997). Birds winter in Iberia and in the southern half of France, as well as the rest of the northern Mediterranean basin (Baptista et al. 1997).;;In parts of its range, the species underwent severe declines after the 1950s with the introduction new herbicides, although populations have recovered to a limited extent (Baptista et al. 1997).
B246;Columba_palumbus;The species is found in a mosaic of woodland and open ground, notably farmland, parks and suburban gardens (Tucker and Heath 1997). It is typically a species of ecotone in deciduous or coniferous woodland. Its breeding season varies between regions, ranging from late February to early September. It normally lays two eggs. The nest is built of twigs and lined with more twigs, grasses and leaves usually 1.5-2.5 m above ground in trees and on building ledges or occasionally in thick vegetation or under a hedge. It takes food from the ground and also feeds in trees, mainly taking plant matter such as green leaves, buds, flowers, seeds, berries, grain and occasionally invertebrates. It is mainly migratory in northern and eastern Europe and partially migratory or resident in the rest of Europe (Baptista et al. 1997).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B247;Columba_trocaz;The species is dependent on laurel (Laurus) forest on Madeira, which is mainly found on the north-facing slopes of the island although there are also isolated pockets of forest in the south (Tucker and Heath 1994). It occurs in the high forest zone which is often covered in clouds. The species nests all year round but mainly between February and June. It lays one egg. The nest is an untidy heap of sticks placed in crevices and caves in inaccessible cliffs and occasionally in heather and laurels (Baptista et al. 1997). It feeds mainly on the berries of Laurus azorica which is the most common tree in the laurel forest (Tucker and Heath 1994). It also eats the fruit of Ocotea foetens, Persea indica, Appolonias barbujana, Myrica faya, Clethra arborea and Piconia exelsa (Zino and Zino 1986, Jones 1988, Tucker and Heath 1994). When food resources in the forest are scarce the species moves to agricultural areas where it feeds on cabbages, watercress and fruit trees (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is sedentary but may move from cliffs to lowland areas to feed (Baptista et al. 1997).;;Habitat loss threatens this species as laurel forests have been reduced to only 13.5% of surface area of Madeira (Baptista et al. 1997). Fires, as result of burning to improve pasture, destroy or degrade forest (Gibbs et al. 2001) and goats and pigs also cause some destruction (Baptista et al. 1997). It is regarded as a pest by farmers and is still shot when it invades arable land during food shortages. The species also suffers losses to predation by Black Rat (Rattus rattus) (Gibbs et al. 2001).
B250;Streptopelia_senegalensis;The species is associated with cultivation, trees (but not forests) and human habitation. Breeding season varies between regions. The nest is a frail, thin platform of roots, twigs and petioles placed in a bush or tree up to 15 m above the ground (Baptista et al. 1997). It may also nest on buildings under the eaves, on drainpipes or in cracks in walls (Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds on small seeds but also takes fruits, nectar from Aloe and some insects (Baptista et al. 1997). It is largely resident throughout range (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;There are currently no known serious threats to this species.
B249;Streptopelia_decaocto;The species is found in towns and cities, parks, orchards and gardens. In the mountains of Kurdistan (including south east Turkey) it is found in poplar (Populus) thickets, bramble (Rubus) clumps, tamarisk (Tamarix) groves and orchards. In cooler parts of its range it generally breeds between March and October in more southerly areas it breeds all year round. It lays two eggs. The nest is a platform of twigs, stems and roots placed 2 m above ground in bushes, trees, tall hedges and man-made structures including pylons and buildings. It mainly feeds on the ground taking seed, cereal grain, fruits of herbs and grasses and some green parts of plants. It will also take some invertebrates. It is generally resident (Baptista et al. 2013).;;There are currently no known serious threats to this species.
B248;Streptopelia_turtur;The species uses hedges, borders of forest, groves, spinneys, coppices, young tree plantations, scrubby wasteland, woody marshes, scrub and garigue, all with agricultural areas nearby for feeding (Tucker & Heath 1994). It uses a wide variety of woodland types. It tolerates humans but does not breed close to towns or villages (Baptista et al. 2013). It breeds at low altitudes not exceeding 500 m in the temperate zone and up to 1,000?1,300 m in Mediterranean areas (Tucker & Heath 1994). Breeding commences in May. It lays two eggs (Baptista et al. 2013). The nest is a small platform of twigs lined with plant material and placed in the lowest parts of trees (Tucker & Heath 1994) and in shrubs and hedges. It mainly feeds on the ground taking seeds and fruits of weeds and cereals, but also berries, fungi and invertebrates. It is strongly migratory (Baptista et al. 2013), wintering south of the Sahara from Senegal east to Eritrea and Ethiopia (Tucker & Heath 1994).;;"Transformation of agricultural land, including destruction of hedges, is thought to be an important factor in the decline of this species, also loss of semi-natural habitats. Changes in agriculture practices have several impacts on the species, as they can both reduce food supply and nesting habitat availability and it is likely that the decline in food is the main limiting factor rather than decline in nest site availability (Lutz 2006). Widespread use of chemical herbicides appears to also be a very serious factor, with consequent decline or elimination of many food plants. Hunting is also significant, during migration and in winter quarters; with annual toll in France computed at 40,000 birds (Baptista et al. 2013). The species is also vulnerable to infection by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas gallinae, which causes mortality (Stockdale et al. 2014). Severe drought in the Sahel zone is thought to be a possible factor in the decline as well as competition with Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto) (Lutz 2006)."
B276;Alcedo_atthis;This species prefers still or gently flowing water with plenty of small fish, and with reeds, rushes or shrubs on the banks for perches. Streams, small rivers, canals and ditches are favoured to open waterbodies, but it also uses lakes, ponds and flooded gravel pits. In winter it becomes more coastal, also using estuaries, harbours and rocky seashores. Egg-laying occurs from March to July with laying time peaking in April in Britain and in May in Sweden. Suitable banks for nesting required in breeding season, but nest-sites can be over 250 m from foraging waters and can occur infrequently in walls, rotten tree stumps, concrete tunnels in canal banks, terrestrial termitarium, or in the burrow of Sand Martin (Riparia riparia) or water vole (Arvicola terrestris). Clutch size can be from three to ten eggs but typically six or seven. In Europe, the main prey is fish but will also consume aquatic insects, flies (Diptera), butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), amphibians (Rana), crayfish (Astacus), prawns (Palaemon), shrimps (Gammarus) and isopods in winter. Very occasionally it feeds on berries (Rubus, Sambucus) and stems of reed (Phragmites). In areas where freezing conditions occur in winter, it regularly migrates south, but generally stays within the species's breeding range. Southern populations are usually sedentary (Woodall 2001).;;Hard winters are thought to be a significant threat to this species (Tucker and Heath 1994), particularly northern populations (Woodall 2001). Severe winters in 1961–1962 and 1962–1963 caused the species to be almost entirely extirpated from parts of Europe. Long term declines are thought to be due to chemical and biological river pollution. The two main sources of this are most likely industrial waste disposal and agricultural chemical runoff. Canalization of streams and clearance of emergent vegetation to improve drainage result in loss of nesting and feeding habitat and declines in fish numbers (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also at risk locally from persecution to protect fish stocks (Woodall 2001).
B278;Ceryle_rudis;This species inhabits small and large lakes, large rivers, estuaries, coastal lagoons and sandy and rocky coasts, dams and reservoirs with either fresh or brackish water. It is also found by streams and smaller fast-flowing rivers and marshes. It requires waterside perches such as trees, reeds, fences, posts, huts and other man-made objects for hunting. In Turkey it lays from August to September and breeds in pairs or in family groups consisting of primary helpers and/or secondary helpers. It can be colonial or solitary. The species nests in earth banks over or up to 1 km from water or occasionally in flat grassy ground. Tunnels are excavated by jabbing at the soil with the bill partially open and kicking soil backwards with the legs. Short holes are dug but the nest-tunnel is typically 1-2.5 m long with an unlined chamber at the end. Clutch size can range from one to seven eggs but usually four or five. Its diet is primarily fish possibly supplemented by aquatic insects, and frogs, tadpoles and molluscs have also been recorded. It hunts from perches, diving into the water to catch prey. Small fish may be swallowed on the wing but larger ones are taken back to the perch and bashed repeatedly. It also regularly hovers before plunging down to take prey in water. The species is generally sedentary with some local movement in response to changes in food availability. However movements can extend over several hundred kilometres. There are a few records of birds from Cyprus, Greece, south-east Russia, Spain, Sicily and Poland (Woodall 2001).;;The construction of dams such as the Ilısu dam project in Turkey poses a risk to the nesting habitat of this species (Biricik and Karakas 2012). They are also at risk of poisoning through bioaccumulation of pollution and toxins in the fish they prey on (Rayner et al. 1991).
B277;Halcyon_smyrnensis;This species uses a wide variety of habitats including dams, ponds, canals, creeks, swamps, mudflats, farmland, large gardens, roadside trees, light industrial sites and dry deciduous forest.Breeding birds have been recorded in April and May in Europe (Kirwan et al. 2008). The species is considered monogamous, but the presence of three birds in some areas suggests possibility of communal breeding. The nest is usually excavated in an earthen bank of a ditch, stream, river, pond or road cutting and can also sometimes be in a termitarium, rock crevice, tree or mud hole. The nest-chamber is normally up to 15–23 cm wide and 13 cm high, at the end of an inclined tunnel 30–150 cm long. Clutches can be between four and seven eggs but usually five or six. The diet is widely variable and includes insects, scorpions, centipedes, snails, crustaceans, earthworms, fish, frogs and toads, lizards, chameleons, snakes, birds, voles, mice and squirrels. It hunts from a perch and will batter prey before swallowing it. Many populations exhibit partial short-distance migration, with seasonal changes in abundance, probably involving mostly juveniles. Vagrants have been recorded in Greece, Cyprus and the former U.S.S.R., and individuals may move more than realized (Woodall and Kirwan 2015).; It usually avoids dense forest except for clearings and is less common above 2,000 m (Woodall and Kirwan 2015). ;Little is known about the threats facing this species in Europe. The small population in Turkey is not widely distributed, with 75% of birds concentrated in five localities. This makes the species vulnerable to any threats (van den Berk and Kasparek 1988). Habitat degradation from factors such as irrigation, overgrazing, dam construction and erosion as well as  are recorded in areas where the species in present (Ozturk et al. 2012) and may be a threat to this species. The use of pesticides may also be a problem (Ozturk et al. 2012).
B281;Coracias_garrulus;"This species breeds throughout temperate, steppe and Mediterranean zones characterized by reliable warm summer weather. It prefers lowland open countryside with patches of oak (Quercus) forest, mature pine (Pinus) woodland with heathery clearings, orchards, mixed farmland, river valleys, and plains with scattered thorny or leafy trees.

The species is monogamous and performs a rolling and diving aerial display. Typically four to five eggs are laid between May and July (Fry et al. 2014). In Europe, the species mainly breeds in abandoned Green Woodpecker (Picus viridis) cavities in white poplar (Populus alba), especially in riparian forests, less often in Salix spp., or infrequently in natural cavities of plane trees (Platanus orientalis), walls or sand-banks. They mostly forage in agricultural habitats, especially meadows (May and August) and in cereals in June-July. Fallow land is always favoured. Vineyards can be attractive if the soil keeps some vegetation cover. Hedgerows (as well as fences and powerlines) are essential perches while looking for prey (Tron et al. 2006, Poole et al. 2007). This species is an intercontinental migrant with almost the entire world population wintering in Africa south of the Sahara (Fry et al. 2014)";;Threats include persecution on migration in some Mediterranean countries. The loss of suitable breeding habitat due to changing agricultural practices, conversion to monoculture, loss of nest sites, and use of pesticides (reducing food availability) are considered to be the main threats to the species in Europe (E. Raèinskis in litt. 2005, Kovacs et al. 2008). It is sensitive to loss of hedgerows and riparian forest in Europe which provide essential habitats for perching and nesting.
B280;Merops_apiaster;"In Europe, this species inhabits broad river valleys, pasture and cultivated land with shelter-belts and scattered trees; sunny hillsides, meadows, clover fields, plains, dissected steppe, shrubby riverbanks in semi-desert, and practically any open and well-timbered country, such as cork-oak woods, olive groves, tamarisks, rice fields, cereal and root crops, and Mediterranean macchia scrub. Egg-laying is from May to June, in Europe and clutches can be from four to ten eggs. The nest is a burrow, which is occasionally excavated in flat or sloping sandy ground but more often in an earthen cliff (Fry and Boesman 2014). It feeds on flying insects, primarily Hymenoptera, and it hunts from perches. The species is migratory and winters almost entirely within Africa (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;In the past the species has been killed as an apiary pest in Moldova, Hungary, Russia and Azerbaijan but present attitudes are unknown. Large numbers are shot in Malta and Cyprus each year (Tucker and Heath 1994). In the long term, greater threats are likely to be depression of insect faunas by the wide scale application of pesticides, increases in large-scale crop monoculture, the canalization of rivers resulting in the loss of riverbank nesting sites, and the development of wilderness land (Fry and Boesman 2014).
B251;Clamator_glandarius;"The species favours savanna-like heathland, often with cork oak (Quercus suber) or stone pine (Pinus pinea), as well as olive groves. In the Mediterranean it breeds between late April and early June. It is a brood parasite of crows and magpies in the Mediterranean, particularly Black-billed Magpie (Pica pica), Azure-winged Magpie (Cyanopica cyanea) and Carrion Crow (Corvus corone) in Spain. The female can lay 12–25 eggs in one season, often laying several eggs per nest. It feeds on insects, mainly large hairy caterpillars, also termites, grasshoppers, moths and small lizards. The species is migratory. Most birds migrate to Africa, wintering north of 10°N but possibly many move south of the Sahara; small numbers winter in southern Spain (Payne 1997).";;Hunting and traffic accidents are the main causes of mortality in southern Europe. In Crete it is preyed upon by Eleonora's Falcon (Falco eleonorae) (Erritzøe et al. 2012).
B252;Cuculus_canorus;"The species inhabits forests and woodlands, both coniferous and deciduous, second growth, open wooded areas, wooded steppe, scrub, heathland, meadows, reedbeds, lowlands and moorlands. In north-west Europe it breeds between May and June. It is a brood parasite; host species include many insectivorous songbirds such as flycatchers, chats, warblers, pipits, wagtails and buntings. Over 100 host species have been recorded. The species feeds on insects, spiders and snails and rarely on fruit. Individuals of the nominate race breeding from the British Isles and Scandinavia east to Russia winter in central and southern Africa. Individuals of the bangsi race that breed in Iberia spend the winter south of the equator from west Africa to Lake Tanganyika (Payne and Christie 2013).";;Declines in northern Europe have been attributed to the intensification of agriculture, resulting in fewer insects and hosts. Climate change is also an important factor where short-distance migrating host species have advanced their arrival more than the cuckoos resulting in a mismatch of nesting times (Erritzøe et al. 2012).
B253;Cuculus_saturatus;"The species is found in forest canopy, open wooded areas and orchards, often in hill country, also in coniferous forest and in birch (Betula) above the tree-line (Payne 1997). In Russia, it favours high coniferous forests of spruce (Picea), pine (Pinus), silver fir (Abies alba) and mixed coniferous and broad-leaved trees such as birch and aspen (Populus). It is sometimes found in pure broad-leaved forests, steppe birch copses, riverside willows, and thickets. It also uses northern taiga to forest edge, riversides, ravines, wetland fringes and slopes of wooded hills and mountains.

In central Russia the eggs are laid in June and July in nests belonging to Arctic Warbler (Phylloscopus borealis), Common Chiffchaff (P. collybita), Willow Warbler (P. trochilus) or other Phylloscopus species, as well as Olive-backed Pipit (Anthus hodgsoni) (Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds on insects, mainly caterpillars, and some fruit. It winters in the Malay Peninsula and Philippines and south through Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi, Moluccas, Lesser Sundas and New Guinea, to the coastal parts of northern and eastern Australia (Payne 1997).";;There are currently no known serious threats to this species.
B120;Falco_biarmicus;"This species typically frequents open dry grassland and steppe and requires large areas of stony, bare or dry grassland for hunting and cliffs for nesting. In the northern Apennines where the mountainous habitat is largely forested, the species occurs in areas comprising at least 50% open landscapes.  most pairs holding inland territories 200–600 m above sea-level, and in Sicily more frequently approaching 1,000 m (Tucker and Heath 1994).

Eggs are laid between February and May. It frequently nests on the old structures of corvids, other raptors or herons, usually in trees or on electricity pylons. Alternatively it uses scrapes on cliffs, the ground, quarries or buildings. Clutch size is usually three or four eggs (Kemp 1994). The diet is mostly small to medium-sized birds as well as some small mammals, reptiles and large insects (Tucker and Heath 1994). It will hunt by fast aerial pursuit from a stoop or horizontal chase, often around a water-hole and often with a pair combining in attack (Kemp 1994). Birds are usually recorded singly or in pairs, but are known to gather in groups of up to 20 at concentrated feeding sites (Kemp 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Most birds are resident and migration is only recorded outside of Europe (Kemp 1994).";Coastal areas are generally avoided, with;In the mid-20th century the species underwent severe declines in Europe, driven by poisoning, shooting and trapping for falconry (Kemp 1994). These threats have subsided, though persecution and the collection of eggs and chicks for falconry still probably constitute the most serious threats to the species. In Italy it is still threatened by illegal shooting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and in other countries where Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) are hunted (Gustin et al. 2000). It is also vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Habitat loss through urbanisation, modification of agricultural practices, construction of roads, open-cast mining, agricultural expansion into steppe and grasslands and afforestation has caused a reduction in hunting areas and prey species.  It also suffers from human disturbance, such as rock-climbers, pesticides, electrical powerlines and interspecific competition with Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) (Gustin et al. 2000).
B121;Falco_cherrug;"It is physically adapted to hunting close to the ground in open terrain, combining rapid acceleration with high manoeuvrability, thus specialising on mid-sized diurnal terrestrial rodents of open grassy landscapes such as steppes and arid montane areas; in some areas, particularly near water, it switches to birds as key prey, and has recently substituted domestic pigeons (Columba livia) for rodents in parts of Europe. It uses copses or cliffs for nest sites (sometimes even the ground), occupying the old nests of other birds. Clutch size varies from two to six, with means from 3.2-3.9 in different circumstances. Breeding success varies with year (especially in areas where rodents cycle) (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species usually occurs singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are sedentary, part-migratory or fully migratory, largely depending on the extent to which the food supply in breeding areas disappears in winter (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrating central European adults travel as far as the Mediterranean. Juveniles are mainly migratory with central and eastern European birds wandering from the Balkans to Turkmenistan, Egypt and north-west India (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Migrating birds generally leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning between February and May (del Hoyo et al. 1994).";;"In Europe, this species has suffered mainly from the loss and degradation of steppes and dry grasslands through agricultural intensification, plantation establishment and declines in sheep pastoralism, causing a decline in key prey species; offtake for falconry is a serious problem, which has caused local extinctions (Baumgart 1991, 1994, K. Ruskov in litt. 2007). In eastern Hungary, landscape reversion following the abandonment of agriculture could have a negative influence, as most prey species require short swards that are maintained by agricultural practices (S. Nagy in litt. 2007). Elsewhere, declines are mainly attributable to offtake for falconry, although persecution, pesticide use and agrochemical deployment play a lesser part (Baumgart 1991, Riddle and Remple 1994, Barton 2000, Eastham et al. 2000, Fox 2002, Haines 2002, ERWDA 2003). Hybridisation with escaped or released hybrid falcons could influence the genetic integrity of wild populations (S. Nagy in litt. 2007, Nittinger et al. 2007)."
B118;Falco_columbarius;The species is found in a wide variety of habitats, from sea level up to tree line in some mountain ranges, from boreal forest and tundra to parkland with deciduous trees, shrub steppe, moorland, open prairies and steppes. It generally prefers areas with some trees or scrubby vegetation. On migration it inhabits an even broader range of habitats, often along sea coasts. It breeds from March to June and does not build a nest. Instead, it uses old stick nests of other species especially corvids (Corvus, Pica) in trees but also uses tree cavities, cliff ledges or stick nests on ledges and the ground. Clutches are usually three to six eggs. It feeds principally on small birds, bats and insects, small rodents and shrews. The species is migratory except for those populations in Iceland and the British Isles (White et al. 2015).;;The use of chlorinated hydrocarbons between 1960s and 1970s caused some reproductive failure and eggshells in Europe showed 13% thinning. With the banning of these pesticides their impact has fallen as indicated by breeding densities and distributions, migration counts and wintering distributions and numbers. The species also suffers collisions with man-made objects (White et al. 2015). Population declines have also been attributed to loss of suitable habitat through overgrazing, insensitive management, and increased tourism disturbing nest sites. Predation by Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) is also a threat (Mebs and Schmidt 2006).
B117;Falco_eleonorae;The species is fully migratory, leaving its Mediterranean breeding grounds in October and November to winter in Madagascar, East Africa and the Mascarene Islands. The return journey begins in late April and May (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds are known to fly as high as 1,000 m during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). They are generally gregarious (though sometimes solitary), tending to move in small and loose flocks, and on migration often associating with other species flying at high altitudes, including F. subbuteo (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They hunt mainly at twilight (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds usually breed and stop over on small islands and islets, wintering mainly in open woodland on Madagascar. It feeds on large flying insects and small birds. Birds nest in the holes and ledges of sea cliffs, or on the ground. Clutches are usually two or three eggs (Orta and Kirwan 2014).;;The species has historically suffered from exploitation and persecution brought about by local people. Human disturbance associated with tourism development has also been shown to negatively influence birds’ breeding success (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Predation by rats is also possibly important on some breeding islands (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B114;Falco_naumanni;"It is usually a colonial breeder, often in the vicinity of human settlements. It forages in steppe-like habitats, natural and managed grasslands, and non-intensive cultivation. It is mainly migratory, with most breeders overwintering in sub-Saharan Africa, although some travel to parts of north-west Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia. Migrants leave their breeding grounds in September and return between February and April (Orta and Kirwan 2015). It migrates in flocks of varying sizes, usually tens to low hundreds, often with other falcons such as F. tinnunculus, F. vespertinus and F. amurensis (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Large numbers, sometimes up to thousands, gather at roosts on migration (Orta and Kirwan 2015). They cross water bodies readily on a broad front, flying high enough to be barely detectable; they fly lower over land (often c.20–30 m), particularly on northward migration (Brown et al. 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It breeds colonially and egg-laying occurs mainly in May, nesting mainly in human constructions, such as large old buildings, houses, walls and ruins, in towns or on the outskirts but also uses natural sites, for example rock faces, clay banks and quarries, and occasionally old corvid nests. The nest is placed in a hollow or below eaves, and it has also taken readily to artificial nesting boxes in some areas. Clutches are normally three to six eggs. It feeds mostly on aerial and terrestrial insects. It is a trans-Saharan migrant although some birds winter in southern Europe and northern Africa (Orta and Kirwan 2015).";;The main cause of its decline was habitat loss and degradation in its western Palearctic breeding grounds, primarily a result of agricultural intensification, but also afforestation and urbanisation. The use of pesticides may cause direct mortality, but is probably more important in reducing prey populations. The neglect or restoration of old buildings has resulted in the loss of nest-sites (Davygora 1998, J.-P. Biber in litt. 1999). At La Crau in southern France, where such nest sites are rare, a population increase in the 1990s may be linked to the progressive selection of ground nests in stone piles, reducing interspecific and intraspecific competition (Prugnolle et al. 2003).
B123;Falco_peregrinus;Birds are highly migratory in the temperate and Arctic parts of its range, moving from Europe to Africa. Those breeding at lower latitudes tend to be resident (White et al. 2013). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It inhabits a wide variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates. Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves. Egg-laying occurs from February to March in northern temperate zones and eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (White et al. 2013). Clutches are usually three to four eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19th and early 20th centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). Severe population declines in the 1960s–1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White et al. 2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White et al. 2013). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B122;Falco_rusticolus;The species occupies three basic habitats for breeding, which are maritime, riverine and montane. It is found widely over tundra and taiga and in the winter, migrants moving south often frequent farm and agricultural land, coasts and native steppe habitat. It breeds from March to July and the eggs are laid in an unlined scrape or depression in a cliff ledge, a disused stick nest of another species on cliff, or occasionally a stick nest in tree or on man-made structure. Clutches are usually three or four eggs. It feeds mainly on birds, with mammals making a lesser portion of the diet. The species is mainly sedentary, especially in Iceland and Scandinavia although juveniles are generally more dispersive than adults and move farthest south (White et al. 2013).;;The species is threatened by the collection of eggs and young for the falconry market (Tucker and Heath 1994) with an unknown number collected each year (White et al.  2013). Illegal shooting also occurs in some areas such as Norway and Sweden. In parts of Fennoscandia, intensive hunting of grouse (Tucker and Heath 1994), such as Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) and Willow Grouse (Lagopus lagopus) may affect numbers of this species. Disturbance of nests through tourism is also a problem (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is also threatened by climate change (Booms et al. 2011).
B119;Falco_subbuteo;"Most individuals of the species are migratory, with western birds mainly wintering in Africa (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, arriving at wintering quarters from late October onwards. The return journey begins in March and April, and breeding territories are occupied again in May and June.  Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs or family groups, even on migration, with larger groups being rare except at roosts and especially rich feeding sites (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It migrates in broad fronts and does not generally concentrate at narrow sea crossings as do many other migratory raptors (Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Kirwan 2014). It is mainly diurnal although partly crepuscular and even nocturnal to some extent on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It occurs in open wooded areas, including wooded steppes, pastures, cultivation or scrub with clumps of trees, scattered trees or copses; fields with hedges, edges of woods. Flying insects form the main part of its diet, although birds are often taken in the breeding season. It uses unoccupied nests of corvids or other raptors, or squirrel dreys, but does not add material and is almost always in trees, preferring pines, but also in other conifers and broad-leaved trees; Clutches are typically three eggs (Orta and Kirwan 2014).";exceptionally on cliffs. ;The cutting of old growth forest patches in Ukraine is thought to have caused local declines (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Some are shot, notably in Malta where hunters are thought to kill 500–1,000 individuals each year. A growing threat is human disturbance, which facilitates nest predation by crows and squirrels. Pesticide use has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg-collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B115;Falco_tinnunculus;Populations in the northern part of the species’s range tend to be migrant, with others resident (Orta and Boesman 2013). Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October and those arriving in sub-Saharan Africa do so from October onwards (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The return journey begins from February through until April (the exact time probably dependent on food availability), and is often undertaken in small mixed groups with F. naumanni and occasionally F. vespertinus (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species can be solitary or gregarious, being most often seen singly but sometimes travelling in flocks of up to 10 individuals, especially on migration. Larger groups may congregate at sources of abundant food. It is mainly diurnal (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species tolerates a wide range of open and partially forested habitats. It feeds mainly on small mammals, particularly in northern Europe, with insects possibly more important in the Mediterranean. The locations of nests are variable, with rock ledges, buildings and abandoned corvid nests being commonly reported sites. Typically lays three to six eggs (Orta and Boesman 2013).;;Past population declines resulted from the heavy use of organochlorine and other pesticides in the 1950s–1960s (Orta and Boesman 2013). In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).
B116;Falco_vespertinus;The species breeds in open lowlands with trees and plenty of insects, including steppe and forest-steppe, open woodland, cultivation and pastureland with tall hedgerows or fringing trees, agricultural areas with shelterbelts and, in the north-east, boggy areas and taiga edge. It is found from sea-level to c.300 m. It is often crepuscular (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The breeding season occurs from mid-April to August (Orta and Kirwan 2014). It is usually colonial but can also be solitary, breeding in disused nests of other birds (most commonly Corvus frugilegus). It prefers the upper part of trees but sometimes nests in cliffs or tree holes, in hedgerows or isolated bushes (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Kirwan 2014). Usually lays four to five white or pale buffish-brown eggs variably marked with dark reddish brown. The diet comprises of large insects, especially Orthoptera but also beetles, dragonflies, butterflies, moths and cicadas. During breeding, chicks may be mainly fed with vertebrates, such as fledglings of small birds, voles, mice, shrews, amphibians, lizards. In Hungary, mice and toads are important. The species is migratory, with birds travelling great distances to their wintering grounds in southern Africa (Orta and Kirwan 2014). Most leave their breeding grounds in August and September, making the return journey between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta and Kirwan 2014). Birds migrate in a broad front across the Mediterranean Sea, not concentrating at bottleneck sites to the extent that many other raptors do (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Orta and Kirwan 2014). On migration they form mixed flocks often over 100 strong with other falcons such as F. naumanni, and tend to stay at very high altitudes for the majority of the journey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).;;Threats include destruction of suitable nest-sites when rookery trees are felled for agricultural expansion or timber (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001, Anon. 2007) and, more significantly, the widespread use of pesticides is affecting the food supply (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001). In central Europe, agricultural intensification is causing habitat loss, and a decrease in extensive grassland management especially grazing is affecting the species's food supply (P. Palatitz in litt. 2007). From 1980 to 1999 intensive poisoning of Corvus frugilegus in Hungary forced the species to change its nest site selection habits, and large colonies have nearly disappeared there as a result, with only 38% of the population breeding colonially (P. Palatitz in litt. 2005). As productivity is generally greater in larger colonies, further decreases may occur. The species appears to be hunted opportunistically during migration. In October 2007, 52 birds that had been roosting at Phasouri, Cyprus, were found shot, with 46 already dead and 6 wounded (Palatitz et al. 2009).
B134;Alectoris_barbara;The species is found in predominantly dry, open country with scrubby cover (Tucker and Heath 1994). It uses steep slopes, rocky areas and arid hillsides, stony terraces, unimproved agricultural land, open or degraded maquis and woodland, including open pine forest (Tucker and Heath 1994, McGowan and Kirwan 2013). The species lays between March and May although eggs have been reported in December on the Canary Islands (Clark 2006, McGowan and Kirwan 2013). It can lay six to twenty seven eggs (Znari 1998). It breeds earlier in the lowlands than in the mountains. In very dry years it may not breed at all in semi-arid habitats (McGowan and Kirwan 2013). The nest is a depression in the ground which is usually lined and sheltered by long grass, bushes or boulders (Madge and McGowan 2002, Mocci Demartis and Massoli-Novelli 1978). It has a varied diet but predominantly feeds on leaves, shoots, fruits and seeds of a wide range of grasses and herbs with insects such as ants forming an important supplement. The species is mainly sedentary (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).;;The main threat in Europe is hunting. In Sardinia regulatory measures exist but are not enforced due to a sufficient number of wardens. In the Canary Islands the remaining population is restocked annually to enable sport hunting (McGowan and Kirwan 2013), however this increases the risk if introducing disease and genetic contamination. Other threats are intensive use of pesticides, outbreaks of fire and the abandonment of cultivated land (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B133;Alectoris_chukar;"The species is found on barren arid and semi-arid hillsides with low vegetation cover and occasional stunted trees and bushes (Watson 1962, Papaevangelou 1980). At lower altitudes it is found on rocky slopes with shrubs and bushes adapted to dry conditions, in vineyards, olive groves and on agricultural land (Pantelis 1980, Papaevangelou 1980, Serez 1992). It has also been found on forested slopes up to 2,800 m in the Turkish mountains bordering the Black Sea (Serez 1992).

Laying occurs mid-April to May in the Mediterranean with 7–12 eggs laid. The nest consists of a scrape sometimes lined with grass or leaves and is found under the shelter of bushes or overhanging grasses. It feeds on plants and insects, taking bulbous roots, grains and shoots of grasses and cereals (McGowan& Kirwan 2013) as well as leaves, buds, flowers and berries (Watson 1962, Cramp & Simmons 1980). Availability of water influences population density even though birds will move up to 10 km to access water (Watson 1962). They undergo seasonal altitudinal movements moving to lower altitudes during the winter (McGowan & Kirwan 2013).";;Severe winters are known to affect the Turkish populations and pesticides may now be a cause for concern. It is also suffering from habitat degradation in some areas (McGowan and Kirwan 2013).
B132;Alectoris_graeca;This species utilises a variety of habitats and different altitudes, up to 3000 m in the Alps and almost down to sea level in Sicily and Greece. Generally they prefer open, mountain habitats with grassy patches, low scrub or scattered conifers (Griffin 2011). Winter flocks begin to break up from February and territories are established March to April with eggs laid from mid-May to June in the Alps and late-April to June in Greece. It is normally monogamous, forming long-term pair-bonds although some instances of successive bigamy and some exchange of partners have been reported. The nest site, believed to be chosen by the male, is a scrape excavated by the female. Clutches are normally eight to fourteen eggs. It is predominantly vegetarian, eating seeds, fruits and green material, but also some terrestrial invertebrates. Chicks, and females in spring, consume relatively high proportions of invertebrates, mainly adult and larval insects. Foraging continues day-round in winter, but is concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon in summer. This species is sedentary however, altitudinal movements are reported in mountain breeding areas, initially moving higher immediately post-breeding, then lower as winter advances. Birds may remain at breeding altitude of 1,900–2,700 m in winter, if snowfall is not too heavy (McGowan and Kirwan 2014).;;Studies in different parts of the species's range (summarised in Griffin 2011) indicate that it is affected by a wide variety of threats, including habitat loss and degradation (Bernard-Laurent and de Franceschi 1994), abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities (Budinski et al. 2010, Rippa et al. 2011), reduced connectivity between metapopulations (Cattadori et al. 2003), disturbance, poaching, unsustainable hunting, extreme climatic events (Bernard-Laurent and Leonard 2000), hybridisation with released captive-bred Chukar (Alectoris chukar) and Red-legged Partridge (Alectoris rufa) (Barilani et al. 2007, Randi 2008), and the transfer of pathogens and parasites from these species (Manios et al. 2002, Rosà et al. 2011). Additional threats include the increase of tourism in mountain areas, predominantly in the French and Austrian Alps (A. Bernard-Laurent in litt. 2012).
B135;Alectoris_rufa;"The species is found in open habitats ranging from Mediterranean to humid temperate zones but not in boreal, oceanic or arid zones (Tucker and Heath 1994, McGowan and Kirwan 2013). It prefers lowland areas. It uses habitats with a wide variety of soils and land uses including dry hilly land with scattered bushes up to about 1,300 m (occasionally up to 2,000 m) in montane foothills, inhospitable dry terrain on lower mountain slopes and marginal cultivation, cropland, orchards or woodland (McGowan and Kirwan 2013). Over most of its range it is associated with arable farming, using low-intensity cropping with a mixture of cultivated, fallow and uncultivated ground (Tucker and Heath 1994). Laying dates vary between countries; April to early May in Portugal, late April to May in England and May to mid-June in France. The nest is a scrape in the ground lined with a few pieces of vegetation. Clutch sizes average 11.2–12.7 eggs. It feeds on seeds, leaves and roots with grasses and legumes particularly important in winter. It will also eat insects. The species is mostly sedentary but may descend to lower ground during the winter (McGowan and Kirwan 2013)."; and avoids forest and wet areas if possible;"The disappearance of uncultivated land due to changes in agricultural practice has resulted in the loss of nesting cover and chick food. In pastoral areas, pastures have been agriculturally improved and areas of low, herb-rich scrub converted to grassland and further habitat loss has occurred through the loss of arable farming from open hill areas, if livestock are removed (leading to encroachment of tall scrub and forest) (Tucker and Heath 1994). Urbanization and agricultural expansion have also caused habitat fragmentation. In the Iberian Peninsula, hunting has led to steep declines; in Portugal over 60% of estimated potential population may be shot each year (McGowan and Kirwan 2013). Also illegal importations of A. graeca and A. chukar may also be causing problems through hybridization and competition (Tucker and Heath 1994, McGowan and Kirwan 2013)."
B136;Ammoperdix_griseogularis;The species is found on dry and stony foothills that are lightly vegetated or bare, occasionally on plateaux up to approximately 2,000 m. It is found in warmer, lower areas than Alectoris chukar where they are sympatric (McGowan and Kirwan 2014). It prefers flatter terrain often close to water (Madge and McGowan 2002). It is not found in narrow ravines, around crags or amongst thick tree cover (McGowan and Kirwan 2014). Typically six to nine eggs are laid from mid-April in south-east Turkey (Madge and McGowan 2002). It nests on exposed ground sheltered by grass or rocks. The nest is occasionally in a small hollow and sometimes lined with grass. Birds feed on shoots, leaves, seeds and berries and also take insects. The species is usually sedentary (McGowan and Kirwan 2014).;;The species is widespread with little human disturbance (Fuller et al. 2000). Studies have found traces of toxic metals in the feathers of this species (Zolfaghari  et al. 2007, Norouzi et al. 2012). Also, possibly threatened by development of dams (Biricek and Karakas 2012).
B129;Tetrastes_bonasia;"The species is found in mixed coniferous deciduous woodland, both in plains and mountains.It generally prefers large, dense forests with rich, varied undergrowth (up to c. 2 m tall) and occasional clearings (Madge and McGowan 2002). Laying occurs in April and May in central Europe and May to June in Scandinavia (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). It lays seven to eleven eggs. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with plant material and well concealed by undergrowth or under roots of fallen trees (Madge and McGowan 2002). Its diet changes seasonally, feeding on catkins, buds and twigs of Alnus and Betula in winter; leaves, flowers and newly sprouted vegetation in spring (Swenson 1994); berries and fruits in summer and autumn; and nuts, acorns and seeds in autumn. Chicks feed almost exclusively on arthropods during the first ten days before becoming more vegetarian. The species is highly sedentary (de Juana and Kirwan 2013)."; It seems to avoid pure coniferous stands and occurs in areas without conifers (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). ;The species is hunted but it has secretive habits and it is unlikely to be significantly affected by this, although in the 1970s some annual bag totals reached c. 10,200 birds in Norway, c. 18,000 in Sweden and 28,000?69,600 in Finland. It is more intensively hunted in European Russia and Siberia where perhaps as many as two million birds taken per annum during early 1990s (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). It has very specific habitat structure requirements (Madge and McGowan 2002) and so is very sensitive to habitat changes, particularly modern forestry trends (Schäublin and Bollmann 2011, de Juana & Kirwan 2013). Although small-scale timber work could have positive effects, as could permitting natural reforestation of areas subject to natural events such as avalanches, insect calamities, fires and erosion. In countries where harvesting is important, e.g. Finland it is often easier promoting management practices that favour the species. The species has an enormous range, so protected areas play only a very limited role in its protection, although conservations units can be locally important in the preservation of subpopulations, e.g. in Greece, Hungary and Belgium) (de Juana and Kirwan 2013).
B139;Coturnix_coturnix;"The species is found in open habitats including agricultural land (Tucker and Heath 1994, McGowan et al. 2013) where it prefers fields of clover, winter wheat and other cereals as well as hay, rough grass and overgrown fallow (Tucker & Heath 1994). preferring areas with a dense herb layer less than 1 m tall. Egg-laying occurs from mid-May to August in northern Europe and late March to mid-June in southern Europe. Typically 8–13 eggs are laid. The nest consists of a scrape with grassy material added and is found in herbaceous vegetation or grasses. Birds feed mainly on the seeds of grasses, weeds and grain but will also eat ground-dwelling invertebrates. Birds are migratory, with most of the western Palearctic population wintering south of the Sahara mainly in the Sahel zone; however birds may winter as far north as the British Isles and Germany or around the Mediterranean (McGowan et al. 2013). Birds may also winter in north-west Africa and remain to breed in March-April before migrating into Europe where they breed once again (Guyomarc'h and Saint-Jalme 1986, Guyomarc'h 1992, Rodriguez-Teijeiro et al. 1992). Migration routes are thought to vary between individuals and years (McGowan et al. 2013).";It avoids bare soils (McGowan et al. 2013), trees and scrub (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Aubrais et al. 1986), ;Agricultural intensification has led to the loss of rough grass and uncultivated land and an increase in the use of herbicides and insecticides which have led to a reduction on the availability of weeds, seeds and insects (Tucker and Heath 1994). Hybridization with Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) is a serious danger in southern Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Chazara et al. 2010).  Other potential threats driving declines in Europe are hunting, long-term climactic fluctuations and drought in the sub-Saharan wintering grounds (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B137;Francolinus_francolinus;The species is found mainly in low-lying coastal areas but also in wide shallow valleys at altitudes of up to 400 m, up to 20 km inland in Cyprus and 60 km inland in southern Turkey. The species uses agricultural land as well as dense scrub mainly alongside rivers with reeds (Tucker and Heath 1994). In southern Turkey, it breeds from March to May (McGowan and Kirwan 2013). It lays seven to twelve eggs (Harrison and Castell 2002). The nest is a shallow hollow or depression, sometimes lined with a few scraps of plant material and concealed amongst vegetation. It feeds on seeds of grasses, weeds and cereal crops, shoots, leaves, tubers, berries and figs as well as insects. The species is sedentary (Madge and McGowan 2002).;;This is species is threatened by hunting in Turkey and Cyprus (Johnsgaurd 1988, Tucker and Heath 1994).  It has also suffered from loss of habitat through intensification of agriculture (McGowan and Kirwan 2013). In Cyprus habitat destruction as a result of the removal of citrus and tobacco plantations and other suitable vegetation cover, primarily for tourist industry developments (tucker and Heath 1994).
B124;Lagopus_lagopus;The species is found primarily in Arctic tundra, extending south in alpine mountain ranges and along or below the tree line, in openings of boreal forest. It prefers low, moderately moist areas with low shrubs, mosses, grasses and herbs  Males prefer territories in areas with vegetation lower than eye level and elevated sites such as rocks, trees or hummocks for displaying on. Laying mainly occurs in May and June, but slightly earlier in the U.K. in April and May. It normally lays eight to eleven eggs. The nest is a shallow scrape with a thin lining in thick vegetation which usually partially covers it. It feeds on buds and twigs of Salix and birch (Betula) in winter. From spring to autumn leaves and berries of Vaccinium and Empetrum are important parts of its diet. It is sedentary in Scotland and Scandinavia, only making short-range altitudinal movements (de Juana et al. 2013).;avoiding rocky or lichen-rich tundra and steep slopes.;The species is hunted everywhere except the Baltic Countries and Belarus. In the Russian tundra annual bags estimated at c. 2,000,000 west of the Urals (de Juana et al. 2013). The species seems to withstand such a heavy pressure, however in combination with other pressures, such as reductions in habitat quality and extent it can have adverse effects (Madge and McGowan 2002). Important declines in Finland were attributed to excessive hunting. Range contractions in Europe have been attributed to climatic changes (de Juana et al. 2013). It is also vulnerable to collisions with high-tension powerlines and deer fences (Madge and McGowan 2002).
B125;Lagopus_muta;The species inhabits rocky tundra with fairly sparse vegetation or alpine summits.It is almost always above 2,000 m in the Alps and Pyrenees. During winter it lives in less snowy regions or uses windswept ridges and slopes due to its dependence on ground vegetation for food. Laying is generally in June, however birds in Scotland lay from late May and those in Spitsbergen from mid-June (de Juana 1994). It typically lays five to eight eggs but sometimes up to twelve (Madge and McGowan 2002). The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material and some feathers, usually in the open and sheltered by a large stone or shrub. In winter it takes food from the ground, mainly buds and twigs of species including Salix. In the Alps and other southern areas its main winter foods are berry bearing shrubs including Vaccinium and Empetrum. In spring and autumn it has a more varied diet taking leaves, flowers, berries and seeds of a wide range of plants. Most populations make limited movements, which are largely altitudinal and depend on local conditions and weather (de Juana 1994).; It is rarely found in areas of high shrubs or below the tree line. ;The species faces some pressures at a local scale, such as habitat degradation and over-hunting (Madge and McGowan 2002). It is particularly susceptible to over-harvesting in the spring. Most habitat loss occurs due to the development of tourist facilities such as ski facilities and collision with cables around ski stations can cause mortality. Human presence may cause disturbance and displace birds from their wintering habitat. It is though that, in Sweden, overgrazing from reindeer is causing declines (Storch 2007). A recent decrease detected in the Swiss Alps, of 30% in a decade, attributed to climatic change (de Juana 1994).
B128;Lyrurus_mlokosiewiczi;"This species is found in subalpine and alpine meadows, on north-facing slopes with Rhododendron and juniper (Juniperus), and on the edge of birch forest in spring and winter, at elevations of 1,300–3,000 m (Gavashelishvili and Javakhishvili 2010). Meadows used for hay production are important for breeding birds (Klaus et al. 2003). Lek sites are found above the timber line not far from winter food resources such as birch (Betula litwinowii), oak (Quercus macranthera), beech (Fagus orientalis), juniper and rose Rosa spp. (Klaus and Vitovich 2006). There is strong site fidelity to lek sites and they can be used for up to 10 years. Older males are dominant, occupying clear territories and displaying the longest and most intensely. Displays occur both morning and evening, and females attend leks at both periods, but mating is only observed during mornings. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with grass, leaves and feathers, concealed in bushes (e.g. rhododendron and juniper) or sometimes under a rock. Clutches are normally five to six eggs (de Juana and Kirwan 2014). It feeds on buds and twigs of birch, willow, juniper and other trees and bushes (Tucker and Heath 1994). Insects are rarely taken by adults but are eaten almost exclusively by chicks during the first 10–15 days. The species is sedentary; only limited altitudinal movements of up to 2 km have been recorded although it is suspected to move up to 15 km in Turkey (de Juana and Kirwan 2014).";;Ongoing road building for the construction of holiday homes in the mountains is currently the major threat and is likely to significantly increase the rate of decline by fragmenting habitat, causing disturbance and allowing increased access for hunters and herdsmen (Baskaya 2003, G. Welch in litt. 2005, Isfendiyaroglu et al. 2007). Construction of summer homes and wood-cutting for fuel reduces the availability of winter foraging habitat. Habitat loss and deterioration are also likely to be major threats with 40% of subalpine meadows within its range suffering from intensive grazing (WWF/IUCN 1994). The density of birds in grazed areas is low. Grazing livestock disturb and trample nests and birds are killed by herders' dogs (S. Klaus in litt. 2007). Illegal hunting is an increasing threat, particularly in the Lesser Caucasus and in Turkey, both by local residents and occasionally by tourists (E. Ménoni in litt. 2007). Dam building and subsequent re-settlement of displaced people is likely to cause significant declines in Turkey (Baskaya 2003).
B127;Lyrurus_tetrix;The species occupies mosaics of different habitats requiring open, sparsely vegetated land for display, good shelter for roosting and sometimes shrubs or trees for feeding above the snow in winter (Tucker and Heath 1994). In northern Europe it prefers deciduous or mixed forests to coniferous forest and spare, young stands to older denser ones. In southern European mountains such as the Alps it mainly uses moderately dense forest of spruce and fir, or larch (de Juana and Boesman 2013). It uses logged clearings in boreal forest, but such successional stages are ephemeral, necessitating local shifts in distribution. In western and central Europe the species uses heathland and meadows and in the central European mountains it uses areas around the treeline (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also known to use bogs and areas of marginal cultivation. It lays between May and June. Laying an average of eight eggs (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Males form leks at traditional sites (Tucker and Heath 1994). The nest is a shallow scrape usually lined with some plant material and feathers. In many places it feeds on birch catkins and buds, shoots, needles, cones and male flowers of conifers in winter. In areas with less snow cover it uses more shrubs and grasses. In spring it switches to berries, stems and shoots of shrubs. It is largely sedentary although eruptive in some northern areas, with flocks moving hundreds of kilometres (de Juana and Boesman 2013).;;In western and central Europe, habitat fragmentation and destruction are serious threats (Tucker and Heath 1994), which occur mostly through increased cultivation, afforestation of heathlands, removal of birch stands and the planting of coniferous monocultures (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Intensive grazing of sheep is replacing traditional grazing that normally helped maintain suitable habitat, leading to the destruction of birch (Betula) scrub and heather moorland. In central Europe, heathland is being transformed into grassland by eutrophication through airborne nitrogen deposition (Tucker and Heath 1994). Related to these large-scale land use changes, predation by mammalian and avian predators appears to have increased. (Storch 2007). On a local scale, other threats include hunting and disturbance at leks. In the Italian alps, stress hormone levels have been shown to be increased by disturbance from snow sport, which may reduce resistance to disease (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Collisions with high-tension powerlines may kill many birds in Scandinavia and in Scotland, collisions with deer fences may be a problem. It is also though long-term climate trends may partly explain recent declines (Storch 2007).
B138;Perdix_perdix;The species is found in the temperate zone, steppe regions and open arable landscapes (McGowan & Kirwan 2013). Its preferred habitat is open, low-intensity mixed farmland with small fields and hedges on grassy banks (Potts 1986, Birkan & Jacob 1988). It is found in large tracts of grassland, or other ground cover that is only slightly taller than the bird itself with some dense shrubby patches at intervals such as hedgerows. Laying occurs from late April in the U.K., early May to June in central Europe and late May to June in Sweden with re-nesting until August or September (McGowan & Kirwan 2013). It typically lays 15–17 eggs in the first clutch but fewer eggs when re-nesting. The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material at the base of a hedge or other thick vegetation (Madge and McGowan 2002). It feeds on seeds of grains and weeds, cereals and clover and grass leaves as well as insects. The species is mainly sedentary however it is partially migratory in eastern Europe and performs altitudinal migration in the Caucasus moving to the foothills in October and November (McGowan & Kirwan 2013).;;"Since the early part of the 20th century, the species may have declined in all 31 countries in which it is found. In the U.K., the reduction in numbers is believed to be as high as 80%; causes probably include factors such as loss of nesting cover, predation, herbicides (chick survival rates in U.K. declined from 49% to 32% once their use became widespread) and pesticides that reduce insect abundance in the spring. All of these factors are the consequences of intensification of agricultural practices (McGowan and Kirwan 2013)."
B140;Phasianus_colchicus;In its natural range, this species shows a considerable variation in its habitat. If it found chiefly in the overgrown edges of rivers, hilly areas close to cultivation and flat land which is under cultivation. In Azerbaijan, egg-laying occurs in April and May. The nest is a shallow depression in the ground, which is lined with plant material from the vicinity of the nest, or unlined. Clutches are nine to fourteen eggs. In its natural range, the species feeds on plant matter such as fruits, seeds, leaves, buds and a small amount of animal matter, for example insects. Where it is introduced it is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a diverse range of food, preferring large, energy rich items such as cultivated grains, mast and fruits. Mass migrations may occur in its native range but in its introduced range it is sedentary (McGowan et al. 2013).;;In its introduced range it is very common and wild populations are often augmented by large numbers of captive bred birds for shooting. However in Azerbaijan race talischensis has been brought to the brink of extinction due to habitat loss and uncontrolled hunting (McGowan et al. 2013) and there is no reliable information on its current status (Braasch et al. 2011).
B126;Tetrao_urogallus;The species inhabits forest and woodland, mainly coniferous or mixed coniferous deciduous (de Juana and Kirwan 2012). It prefers extensive areas of old, shady forest often with damp soil and interspersed with bogs, areas of peat or glades, and with a dense undergrowth of ericaceous plants (Vaccinium, Calluna) but with canopy neither too open or closed (Madge and McGowan 2002). It may use more open forest in winter and denser forest with abundant fruit bushes in summer. Males form ill-defined leks (de Juana and Kirwan 2012). It lays from mid-April to mid-June but with most laying in May. It lays six to nine eggs (Madge and McGowan 2002). The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material or feathers and it is found in thick cover often at the base of a tree (Harrison and Castell 2002). In northern parts of its range it feeds predominantly on pine needles during the winter. In southern parts of the range its winter diet is more varied. In summer its diet includes needles, leaves, stems and berries of a variety of plants. Insects are only important in the diet of small chicks. It is mainly sedentary with local movements in winter in response to feeding requirements (de Juana and Kirwan 2012).;;The main threat to this species is destruction or alteration of its woodland habitat. It is still commonly heavily hunted (even during breeding season), except in SW and C Europe. Other factors possibly involved in declines include disturbance (e.g. development of ski facilities and other winter recreation activities), collisions (especially of juveniles) with high-tension powerlines and in some areas fences, predation (e.g. by foxes), pollution (acid rain) and climatic changes, (e.g. in Scotland) (de Juana and Kirwan 2012).
B131;Tetraogallus_caspius;The species uses meadows in the sub-alpine and alpine zones between altitudes of 2,400 and 4,000 m (Tucker and Heath 1994) and occasionally down to 1,800 m. Birds are found on steep slopes lacking snow cover and gorges and crags with patches of snow and some herb and grass cover (McGowan 1994). Birds prefer south-facing slopes in summer and north-facing ones in winter. During winter they avoid areas with a covering of snow and use open ground with steppe-like vegetation instead (Tucker and Heath 1994). Courtship usually begins in April, with laying in late April and May. Typically five to nine eggs are laid (McGowan 1994). Nests are found on steep slopes in the open, beneath overhanging rocks, amongst stones or in tufts of grass (Tucker and Heath 1994). Birds feed exclusively on plant material, particularly legumes, feeding on bulbs, flowers, fruit and seeds (Baziev 1978). The species is mainly sedentary and in some areas does not even descend to lower altitudes during heavy snowfall. However some altitudinal movement has been observed in Turkey (McGowan 1994).;;Its alpine habitat is threatened by overgrazing, which is easily reached by shepherds with guns, and with their sheep and dogs. In 1993 most of the species's range in Azerbaijan was suffering with intensive military activity, and it was feared that poaching and the spread of long range firearms could have drastic effects (McGowan and Boesman 2013).
B130;Tetraogallus_caucasicus;"The species is endemic to the Caucasus where it is found in the Alpine and sub-Alpine zones of the High Caucasus and neighbouring mountain ranges. Birds use mountain slopes with rocky outcrops, alpine meadows, clumps of bushes and patches of melting snow (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is generally found at altitudes of 2,300 to 4,000 m (Tucker and Heath 1994) and occasionally from 1,800 m. The start of courtship can vary between years but usually takes place from early April. Laying occurs between late April and July with five to eight eggs laid. It nests in the open or under rock overhangs. Birds feed mainly on plant material including leaves, fruits, stems and tubers. Their diet changes over the year depending on availability of the different plant parts; feeding on dry material in autumn and winter and shoots and other materials when available (McGowan 1994). Birds perform seasonal altitudinal migrations moving to lower altitudes to overwinter (Tucker and Heath 1994) and higher altitudes post-breeding (McGowan 1994)."; but avoid forest, scrub and large areas of snow cover (McGowan 1994);The only known threat is from habitat degradation caused by overgrazing by domestic stock (McGowan 1994).
B4;Gavia_adamsii;The species may breed on low-lying Arctic coasts and estuaries but is more common on freshwater pools, lakes or rivers in the Arctic tundra (Carboneras et al. 2014). Optimum habitats include lakes where the water does not completely freeze, which have dependable supplies of fish, highly convoluted shorelines and aquatic vegetation providing habitats for fish and sites for nesting and brood rearing (Earnst et al. 2006). Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits inshore waters (Carboneras et al. 2014), fjords with muddy substrates (Byrkjedal, et al. 2000) and inlets (Snow and Perrins 1998) along sheltered coasts. It breeds from early June (largely depending upon the timing of the spring thaw) in solitary pairs. The nest is a heap of plant matter or turf built near the water's edge, usually on the shore of a clear-water lake with good visibility over surrounding areas. Clutch size is two. Its diet is little known but may consist predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs and marine annelids. This species is fully migratory. After breeding it travels southwards and towards the coast (Carboneras et al. 2014) to its wintering grounds, where it is present between October and May (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The species is vulnerable to coastal oil spills in both its breeding and wintering ranges (Carboneras et al. 2014). Wintering individuals are potentially threatened by heavy metal pollution and by drowning in fishing nets (particularly in the north Pacific (Carboneras et al. 2014)). Although rates of harvest are currently thought to be at sustainable levels (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009), exact harvest numbers are unknown. Climate change is likely to be a future threat to the species (Gavrilo 2008). Threats are exacerbated by a low reproductive rate and very specific breeding habitat requirements (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009, K. Laing in litt. 2008).
B2;Gavia_arctica;This specialist breeds on deep, productive, freshwater lakes (Carboneras and Garcia 2014) or extensive pools with islets, peninsulas and other inaccessible nesting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species is most common on inshore waters along sheltered coasts (Carboneras and Garcia 2014), occasionally also frequenting large inland freshwater bodies (Flint et al. 1984, Carboneras and Garcia 2014) such as natural lakes or barrages, lagoons and large rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds in isolated solitary pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998, Carboneras and Garcia 2014) from April onwards (Flint et al. 1984), although nesting occurs later further to the north depending on the timing of the thaw. The nest is a heap of plant matter placed near the water's edge (Carboneras and Garcia 2014) on islets or hummocks emerging from the water, sometimes also on clumps of grass on the shore (Flint et al. 1984). Clutches are almost always two. Its diet consists predominantly of fish although aquatic insects, molluscs, crustaceans and some plant matter may also be taken. This species is migratory and dispersive, generally moving south post-breeding (Carboneras and Garcia 2014).;;During the breeding season the species is threatened by the acidification of breeding waters, heavy metal pollution and water level fluctuations (Carboneras and Garcia 2014) especially during the incubation period (Gotmark et al. 1989, Hake et al. 2005). It also suffers from lower reproductive success due to human disturbance (Carboneras and Garcia 2014) (e.g. from tourists or wetland visitors) (Gotmark et al. 1989) and is indirectly affected by breeding habitat alteration (e.g. afforestation) (Carboneras and Garcia 2014). During the winter the species is highly vulnerable to coastal oil spills, especially in rich fishing grounds where large congregation may occur, and is commonly caught and drowned as bycatch in fishing nets (Carboneras and Garcia 2014). The species is also highly sensitive to disturbance from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) (Garthe and Huppop 2004) and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B3;Gavia_immer;This species is strongly migratory. The species breeds on large, deep freshwater lakes in coniferous forest or on open tundra (Carboneras et al. 2014). Some individuals remain in Iceland year-round, although most winter on sea coasts or on larger lakes across the North East Atlantic coast from Finland and Norway to Portugal and in the western Mediterranean. During the winter the species occurs singly, in pairs or in small loose flocks in marine habitats (Godfrey 1979, Snow and Perrins 1998). A pursuit diver, its diet consists predominantly of fish, including cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), herring (Clupea harengus), trout (Salmo), suckers (Catostomidae), minnows (Cyprinidae) and perch (Perca) as well as crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects, annelid worms, frogs, other amphibians and plant matter (e.g. Potamogeton spp., willow (Salix spp.) shoots, roots, seeds, moss and algae) (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;When breeding the species is threatened by fluctuating water levels (e.g., due to the building of dams) (Rimmer 1992), acidification of breeding lakes (Piper et al. 2002, Carboneras et al. 2014), heavy metal pollution (Rimmer 1992, Carboneras et al. 2014) (e.g. methylmercury contamination) (Piper et al. 2002) and lead poisoning from ingested lead fishing weights (Scheuhammer et al. 2003). It is also highly sensitive to human disturbance (Carboneras et al. 2014) such as shoreline development and human recreation (Piper et al. 2002), and may desert lakes after increases in human presence and activities (Carboneras et al. 2014). During the winter the species is highly vulnerable to coastal oil spills, especially in areas where large congregations form (Carboneras et al. 2014), and entanglement in monofilament fishing lines (used for sport fishing) and commercial fishing nets causes significant mortality at sea and on larger lakes (Carboneras et al. 2014).
B1;Gavia_stellata;On migration this species may form large flocks of 200–1,200 individuals, with similar concentrations occurring on rich marine fishing grounds during the winter (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species breeds on freshwater pools or lakes in open moorland, blanket bogs (Carboneras et al. 2014) or open and wet peatland habitats (Campbell 1987). Outside of the breeding season the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland (Carboneras et al. 2014) on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn (Carboneras et al. 2014), aquatic insects, annelid worms (Snow and Perrins 1998) and plant matter (Carboneras et al. 2014). In winter its diet is almost predominantly fish, and in the Baltic Sea they opportunistically feed on spawning Herring, Smelt and Percids.;;When breeding the species is threatened by water level fluctuations and acidification of breeding waters heavy metal pollution and the afforestation of peatland or moorland habitats (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is also sensitive to human disturbance from recreational activities and shoreline development (e.g. construction work near breeding lakes) (Meek et al. 1993) and will desert sites if there is too much human activity (Carboneras et al. 2014). During the winter the species is highly vulnerable to coastal oil spills, especially in areas where large concentrations form (e.g. on rich fishing grounds) (Skov et al.2011, Carboneras et al. 2014). The North, Baltic and Mediterranean Seas have experienced severe oil spill events in the past, and remain regions at risks of future spills particularly with expanding oil exploration activity. This species is also highly sensitive to disturbance from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) during winter, causing a risk for habitat displacement and collision (Garthe and Huppop 2004, Bradbury et al. 2014). The species suffers mortality at sea and on large lakes due to entanglement and drowning in inshore gillnets (Carboneras et al. 2014), with potentially significant impacts on the breeding and wintering population within the Baltic Sea , where large numbers of birds overlap with intensive gillnet fisheries (Žydelis et al. 2013).  It is also highly sensitive to disturbance at sea, particularly from vessel traffic along shipping lanes, a particular problem in North Sea and the Baltic region due to high numbers of vessels passing (Schwemmer et al. 2011)  It is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). As a species which breeds in the Arctic it is likely to be affected by impacts from climate change, including habitat changes and prey availability (Ganter et al. 2014).
B142;Anthropoides_virgo;In both its breeding and wintering ranges this species shows a preference for grassland habitats in close proximity to streams, shallow lakes and other wetlands, also frequenting desert areas where water is available (Archibald et al. 2013). In its breeding range the species inhabits grassy steppes of feather grass (Stipa) and fescue (Festuca), and dry areas dominated by wormwood (Artemisia), the essential habitat requirement being access to water for drinking. It can be found on hilly steppes along wide river valleys, shrubby steppes and semi-desert, forest edge habitats, and occasionally unvegetated alkaline flats, or large expanses of rock or gravel. It will often forage in damp marshes and swamps, and is regularly found in cultivated areas (Johnsgard 1983). It returns in flocks from its wintering areas to breed in March and April (sometimes as late as early-June in the north) (Archibald et al. 2013). The nest is a shallow scrape (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) (although often no attempt is made to find or construct a cavity) (Johnsgard 1983), on dry ground, lined or surrounded by pebbles and plant materials (eggs may be laid directly onto the ground). The nest may be placed on gravel (Archibald et al. 2013) in areas partially or entirely free of vegetation (Johnsgard 1983), or in open patches of grass and cultivation, usually less than 1-2 km away from a source of water (Johnsgard 1983, Urban et al. 1986). Clutches are usually two eggs (Archibald et al. 2013). The diet of this species consists mainly of plant material (Snow and Perrins 1998), although lizards and small invertebrates such as large insects and worms (Archibald et al. 2013) are also taken during the summer (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species will forage in cultivated fields (Johnsgard 1983), feeding on ripening cereal crops in its breeding grounds (Johnsgard 1983) and peanuts, beans and other crops on migration (Meine and Archibald 1996). This species is fully migratory (Archibald et al. 2013).;;Habitat loss and degradation from agriculture (e.g. agricultural conversion of steppe grassland (Ellis et al. 1996, Archibald et al. 2013), intensification of agricultural methods and changes in agricultural practices such as increased spring ploughing) (Meine and Archibald 1996) is the primary threat to this species throughout its range. Other threats include disturbance due to rising human populations (Ellis et al. 1996), intensive use of pesticides (Ellis et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996, Archibald et al. 2013), and shooting and intentional poisoning in some areas where crop damage occurs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Ellis et al. 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996). Many migratory habitats have also been lost through the building of dams and the drainage of wetlands (Meine and Archibald 1996).
B143;Grus_grus;During the breeding season this species utilises a wide variety of shallow wetlands, including high altitude, treeless moors or bogs usually with some standing water, and swampy forest clearings, reedy marshes and rice paddies. The species requires inaccessible ground nesting-sites, so is commonly associated with quaking bogs and other impassible mires, especially in the vicinity of Alnus carr woodland or seasonally flooded riverine forest. The non-breeding wintering and migration habitats of the species include floodland, swampy meadows, shallow sheltered bays, rice paddies (Cramp and Simmons 1980), pastures and savannah-like areas (such as open holm oak woodlands in the Iberian Peninsula) (Meine and Archibald 1996). The species returns to its breeding areas in March (Vegvari 2002), where breeding begins in late April or early May, occasionally up to three weeks earlier in southern areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a mound of wetland vegetation (which may be re-used from year to year), generally placed in or near water in inaccessible undisturbed bog, heath, marsh, mire (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986), or sedge meadow (Malik and Prange 1995). Usually two eggs are laid (Archibald et al. 2013). The species is omnivorous in both breeding and non-breeding seasons (Cramp and Simmons 1980). This species is fully migratory, although isolated breeding populations east and south of the Black Sea may be resident or only undertake local movements (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In both its breeding and non-breeding ranges this species is principally threatened by habitat loss and degradation through dam construction, urbanisation and agricultural expansion (including changes in land-use, intensification, expanded irrigation systems and conversion of traditional holm oak pastures) (Meine and Archibald 1996). In parts of its breeding range that are heavily developed the species is threatened by nest disturbance from tourism and recreation which reduces its breeding success by increasing the incidence of successful nest predation by corvids, wild boar and foxes (Meine and Archibald 1996). Egg collecting is also a threat to the breeding population in Turkey (Meine and Archibald 1996). Along its migrational routes and in its wintering grounds the species is particularly threatened by habitat fragmentation and the loss of many smaller traditional feeding and roosting sites, leading to increasing concentrations of large flocks in smaller areas, and therefore increased competition (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Alonso et al. 1994, Meine and Archibald 1996). Pesticide poisoning may also be affecting cranes along migration routes and in some wintering areas, especially where they depend primarily on grain from agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996). Collisions with utility lines are frequent in highly developed areas along migration routes and in winter ranges (collisions being the leading cause of adult mortality at wintering areas in Spain) (Meine and Archibald 1996). Hunting is a significant threat to this species on migration (Meine and Archibald 1996, Nawaz et al. 2006) and illegal shooting has been identified as a problem in other areas (including Portugal and south-east Europe) (Meine and Archibald 1996).
B145;Crex_crex;The species breeds in open or semi-open habitats, mainly meadows with tall grass. It is strongly associated with agricultural grassland managed for the production of hay (Barnes 2000). Suitable habitats include moist, unfertilised grassland and regularly cut meadows in areas of low-intensity agriculture where vegetation grows tall in summer. Across its European range, hay or silage fields in valleys liable to flooding seem of most importance, but birds also breed in hay and silage fields in subalpine areas. Wetlands and marsh edges may act as important refuges when drier habitats are unsuitable (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). During migration it occurs in a variety of habitats including wheat fields and on golf courses. It breeds from April to August (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The nest is on the ground in dense vegetation and is constructed from dead stems and leaves (Green et al. 1997). Often surrounding stems are pulled over the top to form a loose canopy (Taylor and de Juana 2014). The average clutch-size is c.10 eggs and two broods may be raised per season (Green et al. 1997). It feeds on a wide range of invertebrates including insects, snails and slugs, arachnids, millipedes, earthworms. It is also known to consume young frogs, green parts of plants, young shoots and seeds and possibly even small mammals and birds (Cramp and Simmons 1980). The species is a long-distance migrant (Taylor and de Juana 2014), wintering in central and southern Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;It avoids very marshy areas, standing water, river and lake margins and open ground with rocks, stones and gravel (Taylor and de Juana 2014), and also those areas with a thick layer of dead grass or very dense vegetation above 50 cm tall (Cramp and Simmons 1980). ;Chick mortality due to mechanized mowing and consequent increased predation is considered to be the primary threat in Europe (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Intensification of grassland management and the loss of hay meadows and wetlands are considered as the critical threats to its habitats (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Following privatisation, potential changes to land-use and management of agricultural land in the species's core breeding range in Russia and eastern Europe are also possible threats (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). Land abandonment temporarily favours the species, but areas become unsuitable as vegetation becomes too dense and scrub develops. Intensified management of hay meadows, or their conversion to arable, is resulting in widespread habitat loss (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). Across western and central Europe, intensification of grassland management, leading to earlier and rapid mowing of hay and silage, is the main threat (N. Schäffer in litt. 2003). Early mowing and the use of mechanised methods results in the destruction of nests and chicks (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). It is a quarry species in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia, but hunting pressure is considered low. Illegal hunting of the species during the Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) hunting season has been reported from Bulgaria and Croatia, and 0.5-2.7% of the European population may be susceptible to capture in netting set up for C. coturnix in Egypt each autumn. Introduced mammals, such as domestic cats and the American mink (Mustela vison), are reported to be predators of the species's nests, in addition to native species. The species may be disturbed by recreational activities and developments, such as motorways (Koffijberg and Schäffer 2006). Late spring floods can reduce local populations by around 50% (Donaghy 2007).
B152;Fulica_atra;"The species inhabits large, still or slow-flowing waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) and shows a preference for shallow water with adjacent deeper water for diving, and muddy substrates, marginal, emergent, floating or submergent vegetation. Habitats include eutrophic and mesotrophic (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) lakes, pools, ponds, reservoirs, barrages, gravel-pits, canals, drainage ditches, dykes, oxbow lakes (Taylor 1996), fish ponds (Musil 2006), creeks, rivers (Taylor 1996) and river deltas (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), as well as open marshes, freshwater meadows (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), flood-lands, salt-pans, clay-pans (Taylor 1996) and sewage ponds (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It breeds from February to September.

The nest is a platform of vegetation that may be resting on the bottom of shallow water, floating or on a foundation of trampled plant matter in emergent vegetation. The species may also nest on artificial platforms, islands, rafts, tree stumps, tree forks (Taylor 1996) or in bushes up to 3 m above the water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). This species is omnivorous, although its diet consists primarily of vegetable matter such as algae, the vegetative parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants, the seeds of waterweeds, sedges, water-lilies, grasses and cereal crops (Taylor 1996), clubmoss and aquatic fungi (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Animal matter in its diet includes molluscs, adult and larval insects, worms, leeches, shrimps, spiders, small fish, fish eggs, frogs, birds and bird eggs, and small mammals (Taylor 1996). The species is mostly sedentary or a partial migrant, however in Fennoscandia and east of the Czech Republic it is mostly migratory (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997)";;This species suffers disturbance (Evans and Day 2002) and mortality (Azerbaijan) from hunting (Taylor 1996), and is poisoned by ingesting lead shot (France) (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). It is also threatened by oil and petroleum pollution (Azerbaijan (Taylor 1996) and in the Kaliningrad region, Russia (Grishanov 2006)), wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006). The species suffers predation from American Mink (Neovison vison) (Slonsk Reserve, Poland (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003) and UK (Ferreras and MacDonald 1999)). It is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is hunted for sport in the Mediterranean (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), Denmark (Bregnballe 2006), Northern Ireland (Evans and Day 2002) and Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006), and for food in the Mediterranean (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).
B151;Fulica_cristata;"The species requires wetlands with submerged aquatic vegetation and still water for foraging, and waters with fringing or emergent vegetation in which to nest (Taylor 1996). During periods of flightless moult, adults also prefer more permanent open waters rich in submerged aquatic vegetation (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include open freshwater or slightly brackish (Langrand 1990, Gomez 2002) lakes, lagoons, ponds, dams, and permanent or temporary pans, flood-plains, sewage ponds, reed and Typha swamps (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Hockey et al. 2005), and occasionally rivers and tidal lagoons (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996). In Europe this species breeds in May.  Both sexes build the nest; a platform of reeds and other aquatic plant material built either on open water either anchored or on rafts of fresh, green reeds, or within emergent vegetation (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998) on a foundation of bent and trampled stems (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). No attempt at concealing the nest is made (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996), although the site chosen usually facilitates quick and easy access to open water (Hockey et al. 2005). Clutches are normally five to seven eggs (Taylor 1996). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting predominantly of the shoots, fruits and seeds of submerged or floating aquatic plants, filamentous and macroscopic algae (Hockey et al. 2005) and grass, as well as molluscs, crustaceans, insects and occasionally carrion (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996). This species is both sedentary and nomadic (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Hockey et al. 2005), often making local movements (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) in response to rainfall, water levels and the availability of its favoured foods (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996, Hockey et al. 2005).";;The species is susceptible to avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease. It is also threatened by poisoning, both intentionally (pest control) and unintentionally (pesticides used on crops) (Hockey et al. 2005). The species is threatened in Spain (the northernmost range extremes) primarily by habitat loss and degradation due to changes in hydrological regime, over-exploitation of catchments and sedimentation (which are altering the periods of wetland flooding), agricultural, industrial and domestic pollution, overgrazing (cattle herds), the burning of reeds, and the introduction of alien species (e.g. Louisiana Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and Ciprinidae fish which both reduce the availability of food and hence increase competition) (Gomez 2000).
B150;Gallinula_chloropus;The species inhabits freshwater wetlands, both still and moving, requiring easy access to open water (Taylor et al. 2014) and showing a preference for waters sheltered by woodland, bushes or tall emergent vegetation. Suitable habitats include slow-flowing rivers, streams, canals, ditches, lakes, reservoirs, sites with small open water surfaces such as pools and ponds only a few metres across, swamps, marshes, disused gravel pits, rice-fields (Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Taylor et al. 2014), seasonally flooded sites (Taylor et al. 2014), sewage ponds, oxbow lakes and occasionally seashores (Azerbaijan) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). In Europe the species breeds from March to August. The nest varies between a shallow saucer and a deep cup constructed from twigs and waterside vegetation, and can be floating on or positioned up to 1 m above water in emergent vegetation, or positioned on a solid platform of branches in water. Less often the nest is placed in ground vegetation or in low bushes on the bank near water, or in bushes and trees up to 8 m from the ground. Usually five to nine eggs are laid. The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of earthworms, crustaceans, molluscs, adult and larval insects, spiders, small fish, tadpoles and occasionally birds eggs, as well as plant matter and berries and fruits (Taylor et al. 2014). It is a resident year round through much of its range however northern and north-western populations do migrate to southern and western Europe during the winter months (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;In north-west Europe, populations are known to fluctuate significantly owing to severe winters (Taylor et al. 2014). The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Rocke 2006) and may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. It is also vulnerable to predation by introduced American Mink (Neovison vison) in the U.K. (Ferraras and McDonald 1999).
B149;Porphyrio_porphyrio;"It shows a preference for permanent, fresh or brackish, still or slow-flowing, sheltered, extensive wetlands (Taylor 1996) with floating mats of water-lilies (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), tall, dense emergent vegetation, muddy or sandy shorelines and patches of shallow water (Taylor 1996). Suitable habitats include ponds, lakes, dams, marshes, swamps, rivers, flood-plains, artesian wells, sewage farms (Taylor 1996) and wet rice-fields (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species also extends into open habitats adjacent to wetlands including grasslands, agricultural land, parks, gardens, hedgerows and forest margins.

The timing of breeding varies geographically (in relation to peaks in local rainfall) but in Europe is March to June. The nest is a shallow cup in a large substantial structure of vegetation built on a platform of vegetation floating on or standing in shallow water and concealed in thick vegetation. Clutches are usually three to five eggs (Taylor 1996). Its diet consists predominantly of plant matter including shoots, leaves, roots, stems, flowers and seeds. It also takes animal matter including molluscs, leeches, small crustaceans, adult and larval insects (del Hoyo et al. 1996), spiders, fish and fish eggs, frogs and frog spawn, lizards (del Hoyo et al. 1996), earthworms, water snakes (Natrix maura) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), adult birds, bird eggs and nestlings, small rodents and carrion. This species is sedentary, nomadic or partially migratory, with many populations making local seasonal movements in response to changing habitat conditions (Taylor 1996).";;The main threats to this species are habitat loss through wetland drainage (Taylor 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), habitat degradation through the introduction of exotic species (e.g. coypu (Myocastor coypus)) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), direct mortality from pesticide contamination (Taylor 1996, Dowding et al. 1999) (e.g. brodifacoum, a pesticide applied aerially to exterminate rodents) (Dowding et al. 1999), poisoning by cyanobacterial toxins (from dense blooms of cyanobacteria in wetlands) (Alonso-Andicoberry et al. 2002) and hunting (Taylor 1996). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases (Galvin et al. 1985).
B148;Porzana_porzana;"The species inhabits similar habitats in both its breeding and winter ranges (Taylor 1996), and generally requires very shallow water (less than c.15 cm deep, typically foraging in water less than 7 cm deep) that is rich in invertebrate food and is interspersed with stands of low vegetation cover (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species shows a preference for freshwater wetlands with a range of water depths or where water levels vary seasonally, especially where these have a mixture of muddy, moist and shallowly flooded substrates and a dense covering of grass, sedges, rushes, Polygonum, Iris, Equisetum and other emergents, as well as trees (Taylor 1996). Suitable habitats include seasonal and permanent marshes and fens, bogs, damp meadows, the edges of drainage ditches (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), swamps, seasonally flooded pans (Urban et al. 1986), pools in flooded grassland, grassy margins of reservoirs and lakes, slow-flowing rivers and sewage settling-ponds.

The species breeds in Europe from April to July. The nest is a thick-walled cup of plant matter, usually placed in thick vegetation near or over standing water, or alternatively in a tussock, or built up well above the water level. Clutches are usually eight to twelve eggs.The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of small aquatic insect adults and larvae, earthworms, molluscs, arachnids (Taylor 1996) and small stranded fish (Urban et al. 1986), as well as algae and the shoots, leaves, roots and seeds of Panicum, Oryza, Carex and Schoenoplectus (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). This species is fully migratory (Taylor 1996).";;This species is vulnerable to changes in water levels, either through artificial wetland modification and drainage, or through climatic changes. Numbers have declined over the past century in Europe due to wetland drainage (Urban et al. 1986, Taylor 1996) and agricultural intensification (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B144;Rallus_aquaticus;The species requires muddy ground for foraging and shows a preference for shallow still or slow-flowing water, surrounded by dense riparian, emergent, submergent or aquatic vegetation (Taylor and Christie 2014). It breeds in reedbeds and other emergent vegetation in fresh and saline swamps, fens and marshes and at the fringes of open fresh or saline lakes. Other habitats include clay pits, gravel pits, peat excavations (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), river oxbows and channels, damp meadows and rice paddy-fields (Taylor and Christie 2014). On migration and in the winter the species frequents riverbanks, canals (Urban et al. 1986), gravel pits, farm sewage outfalls, marshy areas (Iceland), bracken on islands, flooded blackberry (Rubus spp.) thickets and other very small wetland patches. In western and central Europe breeding occurs from late March to August (Taylor and Christie 2014). The nest is a substantial cup of vegetation that is usually positioned in thick stands of reeds or rushes on the ground in or near water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Clutches are usually six to eleven eggs (Taylor and Christie 2014). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting predominantly of animal matter (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as worms, leeches, molluscs, shrimps, crayfish, spiders, terrestrial and aquatic insects and larvae, amphibians (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), fish, birds and mammals. It also takes plant matter including shoots, roots, seeds, berries and fruits (Taylor and Christie 2014). In Europe, western and southern populations of this species are mainly sedentary, whereas northern and north-eastern populations are mostly migratory, wintering in western and south-western Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;, or rarely on a tree stump or in the open;The species is vulnerable to severe conditions (e.g. ice or severe floods) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Taylor and Christie 2014). In some areas it suffers from habitat destruction through land reclamation and wetland drainage (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B146;Porzana_parva;"The species breeds in the lowlands in temperate and steppe zones (Taylor 1996), extending into boreal regions if conditions are favourable (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It inhabits natural or semi-natural eutrophic freshwater wetlands with still or slow-flowing water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and requires tall stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. Scirpus, Typha, Carex, Sparganium and Phragmites) in or near fairly deep water in which to breed, preferably with a mixture of dead and living stems and a layer of broken stems at ground or water level (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include the margins of lakes and rivers (Taylor 1996), small pools and oxbows in regularly inundated floodplains, marshes (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), flooded woodland (Taylor 1996) such as alder (Alnus) coppices (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and flooded rice-fields.

Breeding occurs between May and August (Taylor 1996). The nest is a shallow cup of plant matter placed in thick vegetation on or near water (Urban et al. 1986), or occasionally raised on a tussock or platform of dead material, preferably in sites only accessible by swimming (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The diet of this species consists mostly of insects, as well as the seeds and shoots of aquatic plants, worms, gastropods, spiders and water mites. Most populations of this species are fully migratory and migrate to wintering grounds from late-August to November (Taylor 1996).";;In its breeding range the species is threatened by wetland degradation and destruction such as lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002), and intensive reed harvesting (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).
B147;Porzana_pusilla;The species frequents similar habitats throughout its range and throughout the year, although its breeding areas are characterised by low, dense, tussocky or continuous vegetation such as flooded sedges and grasses. It inhabits freshwater, brackish or saline marshy wetlands, permanent and temporary, with dense emergent and floating vegetation. In Europe it breeds from May to July. The nest is a shallow cup or platform of vegetation placed close to water on a grass tussock or in soft grass, usually 4–60 cm above the water level. Occasionally the nest may be floating or anchored to vegetation in water, or placed in or under low bushes. Clutches are four to seven eggs (Taylor et al. 2013).  Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), as well as annelids, molluscs, small crustaceans (e.g. ostracods and copepods), small fish (Taylor et al. 2013), amphibians (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and vegetative plant material and seeds. Populations in Europe appear to be fully migratory (Taylor et al. 2013).;;The species is threatened by degradation and loss of seasonal and ephemeral wetlands owing to drainage, overgrazing, cultivation (Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Taylor et al. 2013), reed-cutting, reed-burning and sudden changes in water levels caused by discharges from large dams. The species also suffers high mortality during migration from collisions with powerlines (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).
B515;Chlamydotis_undulata;Within Europe this species is confined to the eastern Canary Islands. It inhabits sandy and stony semi-desert and is specialised to arid conditions where trees are absent and both shrub cover and herb layer are sparse (Collar 1979, Goriup 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998, Martí and del Moral 2003). The breeding season runs from November to June, with peak activity in March and April (Collar and Garcia 2013). It typically lays two to four eggs in a scrape on the ground, usually near some cover (Collar and Garcia 2013). Eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators. Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. Males defend these display areas which are approximately 500–1,000 m apart (Tucker & Heath 1994). The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher et al. 1996). It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and green shoots (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is sedentary (Collar and Garcia 2013).;;The European population is considered threatened by collisions with powerlines (C. González and J. A. Lorenzo in litt. 2007, Lowen 2007), as well as habitat degradation caused by tourist facilities, off-road vehicles, military exercises, overgrazing, sand extraction and road development. It is also possible nest predation by introduced mammals and illegal hunting have an adverse impact (Martín. et al. 1997, Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Martí and del Moral 2003). Recent evidence suggests that the impacts of military exercises and hunting have reduced considerably in recent years, but mortality from powerlines may still be significant (C. González and J. A. Lorenzo in litt. 2007).
B153;Otis_tarda;The species occurs in open, flat, undulating short-grass plains, usually clear of trees, although it uses cork oak (Quercus suber) ?savanna? and olive groves in SW Iberia. A high diversity of low-intensity land-use and lack of disturbance are generally important for year round needs (Collar & Garcia 2013). Nest sites are selected in fallow or cereal fields (primarily alfalfa in central Europe) in areas of low patch-type diversity, far from human infrastructure and with good horizontal visibility (Magaña et al. 2010). Females mate with males on lekking grounds (Tucker and Heath 1994) then incubate a clutch of two to three eggs. It nests with or without a scrape, occasionally with fragments of grass stems and crop stems as lining. The diet consists principally of plant material and invertebrates, although small mammals, amphibians and nestling birds are sometimes taken. In Europe the species is generally sedentary but can be dispersive in Iberia, central and eastern Europe to the Ukraine depending on weather, age and sex (Collar and Garcia 2013).;;Key threats are increased habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to agricultural intensification, land-use changes and infrastructure development which has the potential to increase following land privatisation in eastern Europe (S. Nagy in litt. 1999, 2007, Nagy 2009). Habitat loss and fragmentation continues as a result of ploughing of grasslands, intensive grazing, afforestation and increasing development of irrigation schemes, roads, power-lines, fencing and ditches. Mechanisation, chemical fertilisers, pesticides, fire and predation all contribute to high mortality in eggs, chicks, juveniles and incubating females (Nagy 2009). Hunting is a major threat in Turkey and Ukraine (Y. Andryucshenko in litt. 1999, P. Goriup in litt. 2007). Collision with power lines (J. C. Alonso in litt. 2007, Nagy 2009, M. Kessler in litt. 2012) and wind turbines are also significant threats (S. Nagy in litt. 2012).
B154;Tetrax_tetrax;"This species inhabits dry grassland and, in Europe, it also occurs in areas of low-intensity arable cultivation and pastoral land, selecting areas with a high diversity of ground cover such as mosaics of pasture, stubble fields, long-rotation fallow land and legume crops (Martin et al. 2010). Wintering birds in Azerbaijan prefer semi-desert and steppe areas under winter pasturing. Breeding occurs from February until to June (Collar et al. 2014). The species is polygamous (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997); females mate with males on their displaying ground then nest and raise the young alone (Tucker and Heath 1994). The nest is a shallow scrape usually in dense, short grass cover. Clutches range from two to six eggs (Collar et al. 2014).  Beetles, grasshoppers and other terrestrial invertebrates are a vital source of food in the summer and are fed to the chicks; in the winter plant material (e.g. shoots, leaves, flowerheads and seeds) is more dominant in the diet (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar et al. 2014). The species varies in its migratory or resident character across its distribution. In the north and especially in eastern Europe it is migratory as are the breeding birds in France. In Iberia the species is partially migratory, the main wintering grounds being in the south-west of the peninsula (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";, and avoid areas of intensive agriculture (Gauger 2007);The primary cause of its decline has been conversion of dry grassland and low-intensity cultivation to intensive arable agriculture, especially where this has included the planting of monocultures or perennial crops, irrigation or afforestation. The fragmentation of traditional habitats, by means of agricultural intensification or infrastructure development, negatively affects habitat availability and quality for the species, as well as male density (E. García in litt. 2007, García et al. 2007) as displaying males exhibit a preference for old and same-year fallows which offer shelter and food (Delgado et al. 2010). The use of pesticides could reduce food availability (E. García in litt. 2007). Harvesting with modern farm machinery, operated at high speed and often during the night, is the key threat to females and nests in Europe and is the cause for the observed male-biased sex structure and low fecundity (Iñigo and Barov 2010). Farm machinery accounts for 40% of clutch failure in south-west France (Inchausti and Bretagnolle 2005). Conversion to intensive arable agriculture continues to be the primary threat and cause of continuing declines in Europe (E. García in litt. 2007). It also suffers from illegal hunting (Y. Andryuschenko in litt. 1999), although this is a minor threat (V. Bretagnolle in litt. 2007). The collision of birds with overhead powerlines is a locally important cause of mortality (E. García in litt. 2007). The release of farm-reared gamebirds could eventually introduce new pathogens to wild populations of the species (E. García in litt. 2007). In Azerbaijan, the main threats are disturbance from intensive land use (mainly heavy grazing), habitat loss to infrastructure development and probably hunting (Gauger 2007). Climate change effects could lead to shorter rainy seasons and reduced winter precipitation in southern Europe which could have a detrimental effect on habitat quality for the species (Delgado et al. 2009, Delgado and Moreira 2010).
B413;Aegithalos_caudatus;"This species prefers deciduous and mixed woodland with a well-developed shrub layer, especially willows (Salix) and favouring edge habitats. It is also found in riverine woodland, scrub heathland with scattered trees, bushes and hedges in farmland and well-wooded suburban parks, cemeteries and gardens. In the Mediterranean it also uses maquis and open pine (Pinus) forest. 

It breeds from mid-March to June. The nest is a compact, domed, oval ball of moss, cobweb and hair, covered with up to c. 3000 flakes of lichen for camouflage and with an entrance hole at one side near the top. It is lined with small feathers and adults may continue to add feathers during laying period. It is usually found in a low thorny bush, but a few are built up in tree fork or against a trunk, or hanging among terminal twigs of conifer (Harrap 2008). Normally eight to twelve eggs are laid. It feeds mainly on arthropods although plant matter is taken occasionally during autumn and winter. The species is resident in temperate and Mediterranean areas, but irruptive movements occur farther north (Snow and Perrins 1998).";Otherwise, avoids pure stands of conifers in west of range, but noted in open forests of spruce (Picea), fir (Abies), larch (Larix) and Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica) in central Siberia.;Declines in Sweden and Finland are likely as a result of modern forestry practices and the replacement of old-growth habitats with commercial monocultures. During the winter flocks require large territories and habitat fragmentation and degradation can thus threaten local populations. It is vulnerable to severe winters, which can cause numbers to decline by up to 80% and it can take years for populations to recover. Reproductive success can be suppressed by predation of nests, most commonly by crows (Corvidae), weasels (Mustela) and snakes (Harrap 2008).
B303;Alauda_arvensis;"This species is found in most open habitats and has a strong association with farmland throughout its range, but it also occurs on heathland and moorland, meadows, grassland, steppe, edges of marshes, dunes and even in extensive forest clearings.

Breeding occurs from late March or early April to August and September. It is monogamous but the female builds the nest alone. It is in an excavated scrape or natural depression on the ground among short vegetation filled with a thick layer of grass and lined with finer vegetation. Clutches are normally three to five eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, seeds and other plant material. The diet is seasonal; primarily insectivorous in summer and herbivorous in the winter (Donald and Garcia 2014). The species shows graduation from being entirely migratory in the north and east of its range to being resident in the south (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;The main cause of decline in this species is agricultural intensification. Recent research indicates the principal causes are changes in management of cereal-growing and grassland (leading to reduced nesting and foraging opportunities, and diminution of food resources (Donald and Garcia 2014). In grasslands high fertiliser applications lead to vegetation that is too tall and dense for nesting. The heavy use of pesticides and herbicides is thought to negatively impact this species too (Tucker and Heath 1994). High hunting pressure in some countries poses an additional threat (Donald and Garcia 2014).
B293;Ammomanes_deserti;"This species occurs in desert or semi-desert, mainly in lowlands and is found on rocky or stony hill slopes and flanking escarpments.It is mostly found in lowlands, but occurs to at least 2,000 m in mountains.

Egg-laying occurs from March to May. The species is monogamous and territorial. Both sexes build the nest which is placed on the ground beside a rock, grass tuft or small shrub, or in an exposed site. It is made from grass stems and other fine plant material, lined with softer material and with a rampart of small stones on the exposed side, or surrounded by small stones when in an open site. Clutches can be between one to five eggs. It has a mixed diet of small seeds and insects taken in highly variable proportions, according to area and season. Hard food items are broken against rocks or other hard surfaces before consumption. Chicks are fed mainly with insects. This species is mainly sedentary, although some irregular movements recorded and altitudinal movements occur in mountain areas. It has been recorded as an accidental in Cyprus (de Juana and Suárez 2004)."; It avoids flat and sandy landscapes, although sometimes seen in undulating terrain with rocks and stones. ;The European population is on the edge of its world range, conditions may well be suboptimal for the species within the region making it particularly vulnerable to habitat change. Habitat degradation from factors such as irrigation, overgrazing and erosion as well as  are recorded in areas where the species in present (Ozturk et al. 2012) and may be a threat to this species. The use of pesticides may also be a problem (Ozturk et al. 2012).
B297;Calandrella_brachydactyla;This species prefers dry areas with low and sparse vegetation cover, on level or undulating terrain, with sandy or stony soils. In the Mediterranean basin it breeds mostly in fallow lands but also on dry pastures, tobacco fields, dirt tracks and olive groves. In Russia it also uses more densely covered pastures. It breeds in Europe, leaving its wintering grounds in late January, although arrival on its breeding grounds in the north of its range is often not until April or May. In south-west Europe it lays in May–July and in south-east Europe from mid-April. The nest is built by the female, of grasses, rootlets and similar vegetation, lined with softer material and placed in a shallow scrape on the ground, usually beside a shrub or grass tuft. It often has a small rampart of sticks or stones. Clutch size ranges from two to five eggs. It feeds mainly on invertebrates in the spring, supplementing them with seeds and the green parts of plants in the other seasons and nestlings are fed solely on invertebrates. The species is migratory and departs on a broad front from mid-August through to September and October (de Juana et al. 2012). European populations winter in Africa between 10° and 20°N (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;but is absent in true steppe and it is sometimes present in semi-arid areas but avoids true desert;Main threats are from agricultural intensification (leading to loss of fallows, increased number of irrigation schemes, increase in surface area covered by crops, etc.) and afforestation of wastelands (de Juana et al. 2012). In Iberia the construction of residential areas may also be a threat (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B298;Calandrella_rufescens;This species favours open land with shrubs and grasses, and with a high percentage of bare ground. In the Mediterranean basin it selects areas with average shrub height of 50 cm and bare ground c. 60% and it often prefers saltmarshes with glasswort (Salicornia) in the winter (de Juana and Suárez 2004). Egg-laying occurs from April to June, although begins in March in the Canary Islands (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a small scrape on the ground beside a small shrub or tuft, or in the open and lined with vegetation. Normally three to four eggs are laid. The diet varies seasonally between invertebrates and seeds. In the spring it feeds mostly on invertebrates and in winter mostly seeds with a mix of the two consumed in summer. Fruits and bulbs are also taken. In Iberia, the species is sedentary although post-breeding it groups into flocks that move erratically (de Juana and Suárez 2004). In the east, it behaves similarly although it can leave large parts of Russia in the winter (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;The species is threatened by habitat loss as a result of agricultural expansion, touristic developments (de Juana and Suárez 2004), the abandonment of traditional grazing and urbanisation. Along the Iberian coast, the commercial extraction of sand is also a threat (Tucker and Heath 1994). In some areas heavy predation is a threat, for example on Tenerife introduced predators such as rats (Rattus), cats and hedgehogs (Erinaceus) are a problem (de Juana and Suárez 2004).
B300;Chersophilus_duponti;"This species prefers open plains with shrub-steppe or feather-grass (Stipa) steppe, on flat or rolling terrain. In Spain it prefers land with shrubs, mainly 40–60 cm tall, and medium-high percentage of bare ground. It also occurs in cereal fields outside the breeding season. It is found between 50–1,550 m, but mostly at 1,000–1,400 m. Breeding takes place in March and July and pairs will often have more than one brood. Song-flighting males often rise to considerable height (100–150 m) and remain aloft, singing continuously, for 30 minutes or more before suddenly descending rapidly and vertically to the ground; wing-clapping has been recorded during song flights at lower levels. The nest is a scrape on ground, beside a small shrub or tuft or in the open, lined with twigs, vegetable fibres and hair, orientation mainly in NE-NW quarter. Clutch size three to five eggs in Spain (de Juana and Suárez 2004). The species feeds principally on insects (beetles and Lepidoptera larvae) and seeds. The chicks are fed only on invertebrates, predominantly Lepidoptera larvae, grasshoppers (Acrididae) and spiders (Tucker and Heath 1994). This species is sedentary although probably irregular movements occur during winter. In Spain, it has been observed in winter flocks with other lark species. Vagrants recorded east and north in Italy, Malta, Greece (Crete) and Cyprus (de Juana and Suárez 2004).";;In parts of its range, overgrazing or undergrazing and agricultural development have caused a reduction in its preferred habitats and a considerable decrease in numbers (M. Smart in litt. 2004, Isenmann et al. 2005). Reforestation schemes also lead to a loss of suitable habitat and infrastructure development has led to fragmentation of habitat, particularly by the construction and development of windfarms in Spain. The limited dispersal capabilities of the species reduces the exchange of individuals between populations and increases their extinction risk. Since gene flow between Iberian and African populations is extremely low (García et al. 2008 ) it is important that conservation plans for Iberian populations do not rely on the existence of the African populations of the same subspecies. A recent Spanish study has shown that the species's occurrence is principally determined by geographic isolation (extinction events were exclusively related to isolation), landscape matrix and patch size, rather than habitat quality (Vögeli et al. 2010). Isolation of local populations and reduced patch size has a compounding effect on population density since smaller populations suffer reduced singing repertoires which in turn reduces the rescuing effect from others (receiving immigrants), thus compromising population persistence (Laiolo and Tella 2008).
B304;Eremophila_alpestris;"This species is the only lark to have successfully colonized tundra and alpine habitats. Throughout its range it prefers mainly barren terrain with very short vegetation. In Eurasia, it breeds mainly in arctic tundra, dry stony patches in lichen tundra, barren steppes and arctic-alpine zones.  Also, it occupies open coasts and dunes in the non-breeding season.  In western Europe, migrants of race flava are largely confined to open coastal habitats around the North Sea in winter.

In Eurasia, it breeds from late May to mid-July in Scandinavia but from mid-June in arctic Russia. The female builds the nest in an excavated cavity or natural depression on the ground, which is filled with woven plant material, lined with feathers or other fine material and has stones, bark, clods of earth, animal dung and other materials placed around it. It is usually positioned in such a way as to reduce wind flow across it to as little as a tenth of ambient wind speed and to maximize shade. Clutches can be from one to eight eggs but generally two to five, although clutch size increases with latitude. It feeds on a wide range of invertebrates in summer and plant material in winter and nestlings are fed almost entirely with invertebrates. The species is migratory or partially migratory in the north and mostly resident or an altitudinal migrant in the south. Across the Holarctic Region, races in the far north are wholly migratory, with much or all of breeding range abandoned in winter (Donald and de Juana 2014).";;In Europe, drastic declines noted since 1950s in northern Fennoscandia, especially Finland, which were believed to be possibly due to overgrazing of lichen by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) (Donald and de Juana 2014).
B301;Galerida_cristata;This species inhabits dry plains with sparse vegetation cover and dry cultivations. It may originally have inhabited warm semi-desert and steppe landscapes but it has also adapted to human-modified landscapes, such as open farmed countryside in the northern Mediterranean Basin. The breeding season is from March to June or July in the north of its range and from April in Spain. The species is monogamous and usually lays a clutch of three to five eggs. The nest is a depression on the ground with an untidy lining of grass or other vegetation either beside a shrub or in the open (de Juana and Suárez 2004). It feeds on invertebrates and plant material such as seeds and leaves. The species is mainly resident apart from in northern Russia where it is migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;This species is threatened by agricultural intensification and over fertilization which results in overgrown vegetation in wastelands and road margins (de Juana and Suárez 2004). In addition the use of pesticides has also negatively affected populations (Tucker and Heath 1994). Changes in urbanization practices, such as new housing or industrial areas being rapidly forested along with afforestation schemes and possibly, climatic change are also threats (de Juana and Suárez 2004).
B507;Galerida_theklae;This species inhabits rugged areas with shrubs and a high percentage of bare ground or semi-arid pasture. It is typically found in hilly and broken landscapes, with rocky substrates. It is monogamous and egg-laying occurs from February to June. The nest is a depression on the ground, next to or beneath a shrub or tuft and it is lined with grass stems. Clutches are three to five eggs. The diet varies with the season but is mainly insects, with seeds and occasional green plant material also consumed. The species is resident and generally sedentary (de Juana and Suárez 2004).;;Agricultural intensification along with associated irrigation projects (Tucker and Heath 1994) and the afforestation of steppe areas are thought to be driving declines in some parts of Spain. In Las Amoladeras Reserve (Almería), the cessation of hunting has resulted in a large increase in rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations and thus a rapid decline in this species (de Juana and Suárez 2004). Overgrazing is a threat in parts of southwest Iberia (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B302;Lullula_arborea;This species inhabits a variety of open and semi-open habitats on well-drained soils, with a preference for acidic, sandy soils. It favours unmanaged or poorly managed habitats such as low-intensity or abandoned farmland, heathland, young forestry plantations, recently felled woodland, open woodland and scrub, orchards, steppes, woodland edges and clearings, wooded coastal dunes and parkland. It is monogamous and breeds from March to July. The nest is a deep depression in the ground, usually sheltered by a bush or tree stump and lined with leaves, pine needles and moss beneath a top layer of finer grasses. Clutches are typically three to five eggs (Donald 2004). The species is migratory in the north of its breeding range and in central Europe and southern Russia. In western Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin it is resident (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The main threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation. In central and southern Europe dry grassland, traditional vineyards and orchards and pastoral woodland is disappearing to intensive arable agriculture and fallow land and abandoned pasture are is being lost to invasion by tall grass and scrub. Afforestation is also a threat. In northern Europe as well habitat is being lost to agricultural intensification and afforestation (Tucker and Heath 1994). Winter weather can also cause fluctuations in population numbers (Donald 2004).
B295;Melanocorypha_bimaculata;"Open habitats, usually stony and less grassy terrain (Alström 2004), such as arid heath bordering cultivated land and shrubland (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The breeding season occurs from late March or early April until mid-August. The nest is a loose cup of grass and rootlets, with thinner material internally than externally; the outside may be clad in pieces of paper, rags and dung. It is built in a depression on the ground, usually sheltered by a tussock or small bush. Clutches are from three to six eggs. It feeds on insects and seeds with insects as the principal food source during the breeding season. The species is migratory, although it may be resident in parts of the extreme south of its range (Alström 2004).";;There are currently no known significant threats to this species although land-use changes could potentially be a threat as is common among Asian larks (Alström 2004).
B294;Melanocorypha_calandra;This species occupies open plains, from steppes and pastures to extensive dry cereal cultivations and true steppe with dense grass cover. In the Mediterranean Basin it is mainly found in dry pastures and dry cultivations. In cultivated areas, it prefers fallows, long-fallows and field edges and to a lesser extent sown fields, selecting unirrigated legumes and barley fields. The species is monogamous and lays eggs from early April to July. The nest is made from grass stems and small leaves, lined with softer material and built in a shallow depression on the ground, often under a tussock.  Clutches are usually three to six eggs (de Juana and Suárez 2004). Its diet is seasonal, feeding mostly on insects in the summers and seeds and grass shoots in the winter. The species is resident, forming large flocks in the autumn and winter (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;This species suffers declines due to agricultural intensification and the resultant land-use changes, for example the loss of fallows, changes from cereal crops to vineyards or olive groves and new irrigation (de Juana and Suárez 2004). The use of extensive sheep-rearing and afforestation schemes are also threats (de Juana and Suárez 2004). Hunting (Tucker and Heath 1994) and pesticide use (Papp and Fântână 2008) may also have contributed to declines.
B296;Melanocorypha_leucoptera;This species is found mainly on flat or slightly undulating, dry grass steppe or wormwood (Artemisia) steppe and less often in cultivated fields. Outside the breeding season it is found in wider range of grassy habitats, including stubble fields. The breeding season occurs from late April or early May until early August. The nest is made from dry grass and Artemisia, lined with finer grass. It is built in a depression on the ground, usually sheltered by a tussock or other plant. Clutches are from three to six eggs. It feeds on insects and seeds with insects as the principal food source during the summer. The species is migratory, wintering in the southwest part of its global breeding range and north of the Black Sea (Alström 2004).;;This species has declined in some areas due to cultivation of its steppe habitat (Alström 2004). In addition the creation of shelter belts aided the spread of corvids which prey on the species’s eggs and young (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B325;Bombycilla_garrulus;The species breeds in boreal forest and muskeg, usually relatively open forest or edge, usually coniferous, but occasionally in birch (Betula) forest or mixed forest. It prefers well-drained areas near major rivers, normally including dense growth of fruiting plants. In non-breeding season it is found in a wide variety of habitats with fruiting plants and at least scattered trees, including roadsides, gardens, farmland and the edges of deciduous forest. The breeding season is relatively late with egg-laying beginning in late May. The nest is an open cup of fine twigs and coarse grasses, lined with finer material including grasses, mosses, plant fibres and feathers or mammal fur and usually placed on the horizontal branch of a tree, often close to trunk. Clutches are from three to seven eggs. Its diet is predominantly fruits and insects but also includes buds of various trees, flowers, tree sap, bark, shoots and leaves, moss and lichens, spiders, snails, and varied table scraps from feeders. The species is a partial migrant, withdrawing from its breeding range in winter (Mountjoy 2005).;;Collisions with windows and ingestion of road salt have been suggested as threats to this species (Töpfer 2010).
B430;Certhia_brachydactyla;This species occupies mixed and broadleaf deciduous woodland, particularly oak (Quercus), favouring edge habitats, as well as pine (Pinus) forest, riverine willows (Salix) and poplars (Populus), copses, orchards and parks, well-wooded farmland and suburban areas. In addition it is sometimes found in plantations of rough-barked exotic conifers. The species breeds from April to mid-June. The nest foundation is made from twigs, conifer needles, grass, bark, plant fibres, cloth and paper, lined with feathers, hair, down, rootlets, moss and lichen. It is placed up to 16 m above ground behind a flap of loose bark or in a crevice on a tree trunk, in a building or stone wall and occasionally hidden among or behind vegetation. Clutches are usually five to seven eggs. The diet is chiefly insect larvae and pupae, and spiders (Araneae) but also some seeds. The species is resident, with some altitudinal movements (Harrap 2008).;;It is thought that the disappearance of old forests due to intensive forestry activities and the replacement of deciduous woodland with conifer plantations may drive declines in this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B429;Certhia_familiaris;This species inhabits forest and woodland, generally requiring well-grown trees with many cracks and crevices in the bark for foraging, roosting and nesting. It tends to favour older stands of spruce (Picea), but habitat preferences are complex and apparently affected by presence or absence of Certhia brachydactyla. In the western Palearctic breeding occurs from late March to June. The species is monogamous and both sexes build the nest from conifer needles, bark fibres, grass, moss, lichen, wood chips and the like and the lining, which is added by the female alone, includes feathers, hair, wool, lichen, spider webs, eggs and cocoons. It is placed up to 16 m above ground behind a flap of loose bark or in a crevice on a tree trunk, in a building or stone wall and occasionally hidden among or behind vegetation. Clutches are typically five or six eggs. The diet is mostly insects, spiders (Araneae) but also takes some seeds, particularly pine and spruce, in the winter (Harrap 2008).;;In Europe, populations may be exhibiting declines owing to habitat fragmentation and the loss of older-growth woodland (Harrap 2008) through modern forestry management practices (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is susceptible to the effects of severe winters, especially extended periods of glazed frost or freezing rain. In the north and east of its range populations fluctuate in an irregular pattern, which may be linked to variations in the crop of spruce seeds (Harrap 2008). The species may also suffer from the effects of future climate change (Felton et al. 2014).
B326;Cinclus_cinclus;This species occupies fast-flowing, clear-water rocky streams and rivers with riffles and exposed rocks, and with abundant invertebrate prey. It also uses shallow watercourses in broadleaf woodland, in semi-natural forest and on open moorland and glacial lakes. It requires rocky cliffs or artificial sites, such as bridges, for breeding. During the non-breeding season it is sometimes found around slower-flowing lowland rivers and seashores. Egg-laying occurs from February to June in the British Isles, mid-March to May in north-west and central Europe and early May to early June in Scandinavia. The nest is a large globular structure with a side entrance hole, made mainly of moss and lined with dry leaves. It is set in a in rock crevice or cliff ledge, in masonry or on ledge in wall or under bridge, sometimes behind waterfall and  but almost invariably over running water.  Clutches are generally three to six eggs. It feeds on freshwater insects and larvae and rarely on marine invertebrates in coastal areas. The species is resident (Ormerod et al. 2013).;rarely in tree;"The status and abundance of this species is strongly reflected by the water quality and habitat structure of rivers. Pollution that adversely affects aquatic prey also has an impact on dippers. Chemical pollution, as from acidification (""acid rain""), industry, organic effluent, sheep dips and other xenobiotic substances, are potential threats. Recovery from pollution can take decades, even centuries. In Germany and Poland, declines have been directly attributed to industrial pollution. In southern Europe and elsewhere, hydro-electric and irrigation schemes are thought to be causing declines by reducing flow rates in watercourses. In addition habitat degradation, water abstraction and water impoundment are also threats in parts of its range (Ormerod et al. 2013)."
B343;Cisticola_juncidis;The species occupies open grasslands, including seasonally flooded and grassy wetlands, meadows, fallow lands and cultivated croplands and is occasionally found in urban areas. It prefers to forage in areas where there is Typha and Phragmites reedbeds and Salicornia saltmarsh as well as some bare ground, but breeding pairs require live, narrow-bladed grasses, sedges or plants with similar structure for nest-sites. It is usually found where vegetation is less than 1 m tall. It mostly breeds from March to September in Europe. The male builds the nest (Ryan 2006) low down in marshy vegetation and it is an elongated pear or bottle shaped structure with an entrance at or near the top. It is made of grasses bound together with cobwebs and lined with more cobwebs, flowers, hair and down. Usually four to six eggs are laid (Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds mainly on insects and small invertebrates as well as some grass seeds. The species is largely resident throughout most of its range, but is subject to local movements often linked to seasonal changes in habitat suitability (Ryan 2006).;;The main threat to this species is habitat loss through drainage, irrigation, land reclamation and conversion of meadows to plantations. Winter conditions restrict its range and it is very sensitive to periods of cold weather (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), however populations recover quickly after cold winters (Martí and del Moral 2004). The species is also likely to be affected by climate change (BirdLife International and Durham University 2015).
B344;Prinia_gracilis;This species inhabits rank vegetation in fairly arid areas, including shrubs and small trees, herbs and forbs, reedbeds and riparian scrub. It is a solitary breeder and monogamous with pairs defending territories throughout the year. In Turkey, fledglings have been recorded from April to September (Kirwan et al. 2008). The male constructs the nest and the female assists by lining the cup. It is an oval structure made of dry grass and other plant material, spider cocoons and spider web and placed 0.15–1.3 m above ground in fairly tall grass or a tree. Occasionally the nest of another bird, such as Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis) is used. Clutch size normally three to five eggs. Its diet consists of insects, including beetles and their larvae (Coleoptera), caterpillars and adult lepidopterans, grasshoppers (Orthoptera), flies (Diptera) and spiders (Araneae). It also includes some plant matter. The species is mainly resident but undergoes local dispersal when not breeding. Vagrants, thought to be from Turkey, have been recorded in Crete and Cyprus (Ryan 2006).;;The species is vulnerable to extreme weather. In Turkey, the population fell by c. 80% following an especially severe winter in 1991/2 (Ryan 2006).
B449;Corvus_corax;"The species is a habitat generalist, breeding throughout forested and open coastal, steppe, mountain, tundra and cliff regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It generally occupies more open habitat in the south and north portions of range where cliffs, sparse trees provide nest locations. In middle latitudes it is generally found in coniferous and broadleaf forests, where tree-nesting often more common than cliff-nesting (Marzluff 2009).

Egg-laying begins in late February over most of its range, although further north in Greenland and Siberia it begins later in April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a large and bulky platform, made from dead sticks, lined with fine roots, grass, string and other bits of rubbish, and with mammal fur to make an inner cup. It is placed in the stout, lower branches of a tree, on a steep cliff, or on an artificial structure such as a utility pole, building, sign, radio tower, abandoned vehicle, oil derrick, bridge, irrigation pipe or windmill. Clutch size is typically four to six eggs. It is an opportunistic scavenger, consuming a huge variety of animals and plants. It preys on adult and nestling birds, eggs, small mammals, sick and dying larger mammals, toads, snakes, juvenile turtles, fish and invertebrates. It also scavenges garbage and slaughterhouse offal, dung, and nearly any kind of carrion and some plant matter is also consumed (Marzluff 2009). The species is mostly sedentary but northern populations are liable to move south in winter (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;From mid-1600s to mid-1900s or later this species was widely persecuted due to fear and superstition, resulting in European populations being reduced, often to point of creating gaps in the species's distribution (e.g. throughout much northern and central Europe). Persecution still continues in Iceland and Greenland but throughout the rest of Europe it is much reduced, allowing the species to recolonize areas it was previously extirpated from (Marzluff 2009). Currently, intensive farming, the removal of woodland and human disturbance may affect the species (Hagemejer and Blair 1997).
B448;Corvus_corone;The speciesis found in most other habitats (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It prefers mixed farmland, parks and gardens, also forest clearings, and equally at home on moorland and on inshore islands, coastal cliffs and estuarine flats. It breeds from late March and forms a long-term monogamous pair-bond. Both sexes build the nest which is a rather large structure based on sticks and twigs, often mixed with rabbit (Oryctolagus) bones or wire and heather (Ericaceae) twigs. Mud pushed into base gives a solid foundation and a deep cup is thickly lined with soft materials such as wool, animal fur, soft grasses, feathers and paper. Usually it is built in the crown of a tall tree but in more open habitats electricity pylons are used, whilst on exposed coasts a cliff ledge or stunted shrub may be used and some nests are built on old buildings, in reedbeds, or even on the ground. Clutch size is typically four eggs. The species is omnivorous, but it is mainly a carnivorous scavenger. The diet varies according to local habitats, but usually includes invertebrates, especially earthworms (Lumbricidae), small mammals, frogs, bird eggs and nestlings, as well as carrion. In addition, small amounts of grain and weed seeds are taken. The species is resident, although some populations do migrate (Madge 2009).; is only really absent from dense forests and ;"Historically this species has been persecuted by gamekeepers and farmers because of its habit of raiding nests; however gamekeeper activity has reduced since the 1920s allowing it to recover (Madge 2009)."
B447;Corvus_frugilegus;"This species prefers agricultural land, wooded steppe and riverine plains with fragmented woodland or stands of trees. It is also found in the fringes of cities, towns and villages with large trees (Madge and Burn 1993), and in city parks and churchyards (Madge 2009). In the winter it can also be found along the sea shore. It is a highly colonial species and breeds as early as late February in Britain but can breed as late as mid-April in European Russia (Madge and Burn 1993). Both sexes build the nest, which is a bulky structure of twigs and sticks and the cup is lined with roots, dry grasses and dead leaves. A nest may be repaired and reused for many years. Usually four eggs are laid but can range from two to seven. It is an omnivore; main food items are earthworms (Lumbricidae) and grain but it does take a wide variety of other invertebrates as well as vertebrates such as small lizards, frogs and small mammals, and eggs and nestlings of small birds (Madge 2009). It is less of a carrion-feeder than other northern corvids (Madge and Burn 1993). The species is resident over western and southern parts of its range and migratory in the north and east (Madge 2009).";;Populations of this species have fluctuated since 1900. The main causes of this are changing agricultural land-use (notably the loss of extensive pasture), the application of pesticides and seed dressings (mercury) and persecution through shooting (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Madge 2009).
B446;Coloeus_monedula;This species inhabits a great variety of open country, preferably with scattered trees and it favours mixed farmland, parks and gardens, churchyards, wooded steppe, quarries and coastal cliffs (Madge and de Juana 2014).The species forms a long term pair bond. Egg-laying occurs from late April in Britain and northern Europe, mid-April in central Europe, and the first half of May in north-west Russia. The nest varies in size, but can be massive as a fresh nest is built each year on top of older ones. The foundation is a mass of branches and twigs, interspersed with mud and dung and the inner cup is quite deep and thick and constructed of mosses, rotten wood, feathers and fur and wool, usually in some cavity of some kind. Clutches can be from three to eight eggs but usually four. It feeds mostly on the ground and is omnivorous. During the breeding season it is mainly carnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of invertebrates, eggs and household scraps (Madge and de Juana 2014). The species is sedentary in Britain but continental birds will undergo extensive south-westerly movements in autumn (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).; Across Europe it is only absent from high mountain plateaux, tundra, extensive wetland or afforested areas and a few small islands (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). ;The species is now extinct in in Malta, where it was formerly common, as a result of persecution (Madge and de Juana 2014).
B441;Cyanopica_cyanus;"In Europe this species frequents open woodland and evergreen stands of both cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia), as well as pine-oak stands. At the edge of its distribution it also breeds in deciduous open woods of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and in Mediterranean almond (Prunus dulcis) and olive (Olea europaea) groves (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).

It nests in loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1993) and egg-laying occurs from May to June. The nest is a mass of twigs and rootlets, often domed by naturally amassed twigs. The deep cup is lined with soft plant material, particularly animal fur and it is placed inside the outer foliage of a long branch and rarely more than two metres above the ground, sometimes at ground level itself. It is omnivorous and takes a wide variety of food items, especially insects and their larvae, and quite a number of fruits and nuts (Madge 2009). The species does not undertake migration but shows complex post-breeding dispersal movements (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;This species suffers from the destruction of extensive stands of holm oaks (Madge 2009) as well as variable and inappropriate management in this habitat (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Competition with increasing numbers of Pica pica may have caused local decreases (Madge 2009).
B440;Garrulus_glandarius;This species inhabits woodlands and forests of all kinds, especially beech (Fagus) and hornbeam (Carpinus), although oak (Quercus) is preferred. It can also be found in parks, orchards and large gardens.  Northern populations also occur in conifers and birch (Betula) forest. In most of Europe, egg-laying occurs mainly from mid-April. The nest is built by both sexes and is a well-constructed, platform of twigs around a relatively deep cup, lined with soft plant materials. It is usually placed four to six metres above ground and often at the junction of substantial branch and main trunk. Clutches are typically five to seven eggs. It is omnivorous, feeding mostly on invertebrates during the breeding season. It also takes eggs and nestlings of a range of birds up to the size of a sparrowhawk (Accipiter) and a wide variety of seeds and berries, especially in autumn and winter, including grain, beech mast, chestnuts and acorns. Throughout the autumn and into winter it builds up caches of acorns, burying them individually in leaf litter on forest floor or beneath clumps of brambles or ferns, and has been estimated that a single bird could store c. 3000 acorns in one month (Madge 2009). The species sedentary although some subspecies have migratory populations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;"The species's colourful blue wing feathers became very fashionable in the early 20th century, both as hat decoration and in the making of ""flies"" for salmon-fishing. It was also long persecuted by gamekeepers and farmers due to its habit of raiding nests, although persecution is now much less widespread (Madge 2009)."
B443;Nucifraga_caryocatactes;"This species occupies coniferous forest and mixed conifer and birch (Betula) forest where conifers predominate and is found from taiga lowlands (Madge 2009) up to 2,300 m in the Alps (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In continental Europe it mainly inhabits mountain forests, especially where forests broken by clearings and alpine meadows. Prime habitat in Europe is composed of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Swiss pine (Pinus cembra); mixed forests of silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), black pine (Pinus nigra) and Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce) also important, especially if hazel (Corylus) also present (Madge 2009). Breeding begins from March and clutches are usually three or four eggs (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a mass of twigs and branches, intertwined with bramble (Rubus) shoots and lichens, with a deep cup, lined with soft plant materials, including willow (Salix) seeds, mosses and lichens. It is normally placed around six metres from the ground close to main trunk of a conifer. Its primary food is pine nuts, particularly those of Siberian pine. It is a specialized nut-eater and has a prominent ridge inside base of lower mandible serving as ideal nut-cracking tool. During the spring and summer it also takes a wide variety of invertebrates, small rodents and small birds (Madge 2009). The species is highly resident in its breeding areas (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B439;Perisoreus_infaustus;This species occupies boreal forest (taiga zone). It favours dense closed-canopy, mature forest of spruce (Picea), pines (Pinus) and larches (Larix), with stands of birches (Betula) and is found in lowlands and foothills (Madge 2009). It is a solitary nester and in Scandinavia, eggs are laid in late March and April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a rather loose structure of twigs, with well-lined cup of lichens, feathers and reindeer (Rangifer) hairs, placed at base of branch close to the trunk of a tree. Clutches are three or four eggs. It is omnivorous, consuming berries, seeds, various insects and their larvae and a wide variety of other invertebrates. It also feeds on carrion, and scavenges on scraps provided by humans, takes eggs and nestlings of small birds, and small rodents (Madge 2009). The species is highly sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997);;In parts of European range it is declining, due to the increased exploitation of its habitat through felling, road-building, settlements and agriculture (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Forest fragmentation opens up dense forest and allowing such predators such as Corvus corax easier access to nests of this and other bird species (Madge 2009). Other corvids, including other members of this species, are also known to predate nests and the species may suffer from competition from Eurasian Jay (Garrulus glandarius) (Madge and Burn 1993).
B442;Pica_pica;"This species inhabits a tremendous variety of open country, preferably with at least scattered trees (Madge 2009). It is evenly distributed in urban, rural and natural landscapes and frequents parks, gardens, most farmland, heaths, freshwater, wetland, dunes, woodland and forest fringes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).

The breeding season begins with nest-building as early as December in Britain and mid-April is the peak time for first egg-laying. Breeding dates are similar elsewhere in Europe. The nest is built by both sexes although the female does the majority of construction. It is made from sticks and twigs, with a side entrance protected by thorny twigs. A deep cup is thickly lined with soft materials such as wool, animal fur, soft grasses and feathers, usually placed at variable height in crown of tall tree; normally a fresh nest built each year, although in some cases an old nest may be repaired. It is omnivorous but principally a carnivorous scavenger. The diet varies according to local habitats, but generally consists of invertebrates, small mammals and lizards, frogs, bird eggs and nestlings, as well as carrion. In addition, various seeds, berries and fruits are taken seasonally. The species is resident (Madge 2009).";;In the past the species has been persecuted by gamekeepers and farmers due to its habit of raiding nests and also of feeding on ectoparasites on livestock, which sometimes results in aggravated sores for the host animal. However, persecution has fallen since the 1920s (Madge 2009).
B445;Pyrrhocorax_graculus;"The species inhabits high-altitude mountain pastures with rocky ravines and cliff faces; above the tree-line in summer and descending into upper valleys in winter. Often found around alpine villages and ski resorts in Europe and breeds chiefly between 1,260 m and 2,880 (Madge and Burn 1993). Egg-laying occurs mainly in early May to mid-June. It often forms a lifelong monogamous pair-bond and partners will remain together throughout year.

The nest is built by both sexes and is a bulky structure of sticks, roots and similar, lined with grasses, feathers and moss, typically on a ledge or shelf near the roof of a cave or rock chimney, rock crevice or cliff face. Larger caves with small entrances are favoured. Occasionally uses roof spaces of old buildings, mine-shafts and similar structures. Its diet consists primarily of invertebrates in spring and summer, with a more varied diet in autumn and winter. It will also take small amphibians and reptiles, nestling small birds, eggs and small rodents. In autumn and winter extensive range of seeds, berries and fruits are added to the diet. Also consumes a wide range of discarded human food (Madge 2009). The species is sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B444;Pyrrhocorax_pyrrhocorax;"This species is found on coastal cliffs in western Europe and in high mountain pastures with rocky crags elsewhere. Coastal populations such as those found in Ireland, Britain, Brittany, Canaries, and north-west Spain, favour sea cliffs with rocky crags, interspersed with closely grazed grassland. Populations found further inland occur in high mountain pastures above the tree-line, favouring sheep-grazed slopes. The species is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond (Madge 2009).

Egg-laying begins in March in Britain and in mid to late April in the Caucasus (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a mass of sticks, thickly lined with wool, rarely all wool and built typically in the roof of a cave, rock chimney, or disused quarry, but also uses roof spaces of disused buildings, old mine shafts or similar sites. Clutches are usually four eggs. It is chiefly insectivorous, particulary in spring and summer, but also feeds on a wide variety of other invertebrates and rarely on small vertebrates such as lizards (Lacertidae) and small mammals. In autumn and winter, when invertebrate food more difficult to find, it takes grain, seeds and small berries, including those of rowan (Sorbus), pear (Pyrus), juniper (Juniperus), sea-buckthorn (Hippophae) and olive (Olea). The species is essentially sedentary (Madge 2009).";;The most important cause of declines in the species is changes in grazing regimes (Madge 2009) and conversion of grazing habitat to forestry, tourist-related developments or intensive farming (Tucker and Heath 1994). Historically, grazing animals roamed freely over mountain slopes and coastal cliffs, keeping vegetation short and ideal for invertebrates (Madge 2009). In the Alps, it is thought competition with Alpine Chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus) and Eurasian Jackdaw (Corvus monedula) may be detrimental to the species (Madge and Burn 1993). The species has also suffered from persecution (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and they were shot for sport during the 19th and 20th centuries (Wilmore 1977). The conversion of grazing land to arable may also be a threat to this species (Bibby et al. 1989).
B469;Calcarius_lapponicus;This species breeds in tundra at the edge of the tree-line, where it is found in sedges (Carex) and grasses (Poaceae) interspersed with heather and small trees such as Lapland rhododendron (Rhododendron lapponicum), tamarack (Larix laricina), spruce (Picea) and willow (Salix). In Greenland, it is more often found inland than on the coast and prefers wet swampy land in a low carpet of heath, with crowberry (Empetrum) and dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa). On migration and in winter it is found in open areas and farmland (Rising and Christie 2013). Egg-laying generally occurs between the end of May and mid-July but is timed so that the young leave the nest during the peak abundance of adult flies (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a cup of dry grass, leaves and moss, lined with hair and feathers, placed on the ground, usually near a clump of vegetation or occasionally under a tipped rock, and generally concealed in vegetation. Clutches are normally four to six eggs. In the breeding season it feeds principally on invertebrates and mainly on seeds in the winter (Rising and Christie 2013). The species is migratory with European birds wintering mainly in south European Russia and Ukraine and those from Greenland in North America and north-west Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;As this species feeds in agricultural lands, some mortality may result from the ingestion of pesticides (Rising and Christie 2013). In addition the species may be threatened by future climate change (Virkkala et al. 2008).
B463;Emberiza_aureola;Within Europe this species breeds in a wide range of moist or wet, fragmented habitats including river valleys, wet scrub-meadows and bogs. It also inhabits cultivated areas, light conifer plantations and dry meadows. Preferentially it occupies open wet meadows where willow, alder or birch are mixed with sedge, grass, marsh cinquefoil or similar vegetation. In the winter it is found in flocks on cultivated or poor-quality arable land and grassland (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The nest is built by the female alone and is placed either on the ground in a depression under tussocks or roots or slightly above ground in well covered vegetation. It is constructed of dry grass and stalks lined with soft grass, rootlets and sometimes hair. Clutch size can vary between three and seven but most commonly four to five. During breeding it feeds principally on invertebrates and seeds at other times of the year. Plant material is taken all year round. The species is migratory and has a very short breeding period arriving at its breeding grounds late June and leaving at the end of July. It winters in south-east Asia (Copete 2011).;;Since many populations on pristine breeding grounds have dropped rapidly, the decline is likely to be driven by excessive trapping at migration and, in particular, wintering sites (S. Chan in litt. 2003, P. Round in litt. 2003, M. Williams in litt. 2007, S. Chan in litt. 2007). Declines caused by pressures on the wintering grounds are compounded by a reduction in habitat quality on the breeding grounds in parts of its range, particularly drying of meadows caused by changes in the flow pattern of rivers, a result of dam construction upstream (O. Goroshko in litt. 2003, J. Kamp in litt. 2007).
B465;Emberiza_bruniceps;This species is characteristic of irrigated farmland where it occurs in areas of scrub, along field borders, groves, canal banks, river valleys and in tree shelterbelts (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997). The breeding season starts in May. The nest is built by the female, usually in a shrub, near the ground. The clutch, normally two to five eggs, is incubated by the female. The chicks hatch after 10–14 days. They are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 12–13 days. The species is migratory and leaves the breeding grounds to winter in the Indian subcontinent from the second half of July through to August. The species takes seeds throughout the year. However, during the breeding season it mainly feeds on a wide variety of small invertebrate species (Copete 2011).;;There is no evidence of substantial threats (BirdLife International 2015).
B457;Emberiza_buchanani;During the breeding season this species utilises dry, rocky mountainous terrain and upland plateaux with some grassy and weedy vegetation, at an altitude of 900–1,400 m, occasionally up to 2,400 m Asl (Madge 2011, Hagemeijer & Blair 1997). The species's breeding season starts in April. The nest is built by the female and is well hidden under vegetation or a sheltering boulder, on the ground. Usually three to six eggs are laid between April and late May. Little is known about the rest of the breeding process. In July and August the species flocks in small groups prior to migration which commences in August. Wintering areas are situated outside of Europe, mainly in India (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011). The species forages on seeds and shoots of dry-country plants. During the breeding season the chicks are fed small invertebrates, in particular weevils, other beetles, bugs, ants, grasshoppers and snails (Madge 2011).;;The population is suspected to be stable, no substantial threats have been reported (BirdLife International 2015) besides overgrazing of sparse vegetation by domestic animals that may lead to habitat degradation (Madge 2011).
B460;Emberiza_caesia;"This species favours dry barren habitats with some low-lying vegetation, on hillsides, rocky islands as well as on cultivated land, up to 1,300 m Asl, often near the coast (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011). Nesting is reported from mid-April to mid-June. The nest is made by the female and it is placed on the ground against a rock or amongst the roots of a shrubby plant. The clutch, usually four to six eggs, is incubated mainly by the female. Hatching takes place after 12–14 days. Nestlings are reared by both parents. They leave the nest after 12–14 days. The species is migratory; breeding areas are vacated in July and August. Wintering areas are situated outside Europe, in north-eastern Africa (Madge 2011). The species forages almost entirely on the ground. The diet consists of small seeds, in particular of grasses and small invertebrates are also taken, in particular ants (Madge 2011).";;There is no evidence for substantial threats (BirdLife International 2015).
B456;Emberiza_cia;The species utilises semi-arid, sparsely vegetated areas at lower and middle altitudes. It prefers sunny hill sides with rocky outcrops and scattered bushes or trees. Locally it also occurs in quarries, vineyards and other terrains with an alternation of bare soil or rocks and sparsely vegetated areas (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Copete 2011). The species is considered resident over most of its range. The breeding season starts in March and ends in August, although occasionally it finishes in mid-September. The nest is built by the female. It is placed on the ground, protected by vegetation or at the base of a rock. The clutch, usually three to five eggs, is incubated by the female. The chicks hatch after 13–15 days. They are fed by both parents. They leave the nest after 9–13 days and become independent three weeks later (Copete 2011). The species feeds mostly on a wide variety small invertebrate prey during the breeding season. Outside the breeding season the diet consists mainly of seeds of herbs or other plants (Copete 2011).;;Habitat loss as a consequence of agricultural intensification, urbanisation and reforestation led to a decline in the past between 1970–1990 (Copete 2011).
B458;Emberiza_cineracea;This species breeds on dry rocky slopes and uplands with shrubby vegetation and sometimes conifers. Migrating birds are regularly recorded in lowland agricultural land and semi-deserts (Albayrak et al. 2003). Not much is known of the breeding habits of this species. Eggs have been reported in western Turkey in late April and in eastern Turkey in late May, where recently fledged young have been noted as late as mid-August. The nest is probably built by the female only and is a foundation of grass seed-heads, stalks and thistle leaves, lined with hair and rootlets, placed on the ground against a rock or concealed by a tuft of vegetation. Clutch size is four to six eggs (Madge 2011). There is little information on the species's diet but it appears to be principally small invertebrates in the breeding season and seeds outside the breeding season (Tucker and Heath 1994, Madge 2011). The species is migratory, with all breeding areas vacated from late August onwards. The two races differ somewhat in their migration routes and winter ranges, although a certain amount of intermingling takes place at passage stopovers. E. c. cineracea winters in Sudan, Eritrea and southern Saudi Arabia while E. c. semenowi is thought to winter in south-west Arabia (Madge 2011).;;Changes in grazing pressure by sheep and goats could affect the population size. High grazing pressure could result in the trampling of nests, whereas too little grazing could reduce the area of open feeding sites (Albayrak et al. 2003). Remaining habitat in western Turkey is being developed rapidly for tourism (Tucker and Heath 1994). Suitable habitats in south-east Turkey have been flooded by dam construction, resulting both in direct habitat loss and the relocation of displaced villagers to new, currently unpopulated areas (Albayrak et al. 2003).
B455;Emberiza_cirlus;The breeding habitat of this species is characterised by bushes and small woodlands, surrounded by open landscape up to 1,500 m asl. It also occupies forest edges and orchards. The highest densities are reached in small-scale heterogeneous, extensively managed farmland in a sunny climate. In the northern part of its range the species is partially migratory. In the southern part it is sedentary showing short distance, often altitudinal, movements. In winter it requires fallow fields or stubble fields with weeds (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Brambilla et al. 2008, Copete 2011). The breeding season is between mid-April and early-September. The nest is usually built in shrubs and occasionally in trees. The clutch, usually two to five eggs, is incubated by the female. The chicks hatch after 12–13 days. They are raised by both parents and leave the nest after 11–13 days (Copete 2011). During the breeding season the species mainly takes a wide variety of small invertebrates, but during the rest of the year it mainly feeds on seeds of herbs and grasses (Copete 2011).;;"Past declines in the species's population were related to habitat changes, as a result of intensification and scale enlargement of farming practices and forestation. Intensive research into the causes of the decline of the small British population of the species in the past revealed a complex of factors affecting the population: loss of winter food due to the shift from spring- to winter-sown crops, the general loss of arable cropping in grass-dominated landscapes; the loss of large insect food for chicks in the breeding season due to the intensification of grassland management; and the loss of suitable nest sites due to the removal of hedges and unsympathetic management of those that remained (Evans 1997, Evans et al. 1997). High input of herbicides results in the reduction of food availability for the species (Bradbury et al. 2008)."
B453;Emberiza_citrinella;"This is a characteristic species of the transition zone between woodland and open country, such as (extensively managed) farmland with hedges, forest clearings, young plantations, scrubs, heath and natural grasslands. The species can occur op to 2,100 m Asl. The species is completely migratory in the northern part of its breeding range; elsewhere it is partially migratory or sedentary. During winter it gathers in flocks, often in farmland on stubble fields or other weedy habitats (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). Normally the breeding season starts in April and late broods may even be started in September. The nest is built by the female. It is placed on the ground, often in field boundaries or ditches, well hidden among the vegetation, or in hedges or isolated bushes. The clutch, usually three to five eggs, is normally incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after 12–14 days. They are brooded by the female, the male delivering food. The nestling period is 11–13 days (Bradbury et al. 2000, Copete 2011). The species mainly takes seeds and other plant materials from a variety of tree, herb and grass species. During the breeding season it shifts to invertebrates, which it feeds to nestlings (Copete 2011).";;The population is suspected to be in decline owing to a reduction in cultivation of cereal crops and the intensification of farmland management. Agricultural efficiency measures such as removal of hedgerows, filling or clearing of ditches and grazing or ploughing right up to the field edge are likely to have adversely affected the species (Bradbury et al. 2000, BirdLife International 2015). Furthermore the species suffers indirectly from the use of insecticides and herbicides, as these reduce the abundance of arthropods and the availability of weedy patches rich in seeds (Perkins et al. 2002, Morris 2005, Hart et al. 2006). The species interbreeds with Emberiza leucocephalos in the contact zone of both species in the most western part of its range. According to Panov et al. (2003) the hybridisation process will intensify in the contact zone of both species as they are very similar in behaviour and habitat choice. The long-term impact of this process is unclear (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011, BirdLife 2015).
B459;Emberiza_hortulana;This species utilises a variety of breeding habitats, preferably situated in areas with a continental climate (many hours of sunshine and low rainfall). In the northern part of its range it occurs mainly in cultivated land, preferring low-intensity, mixed farmland on light soils, with sparsely vegetated spots and scattered or lines of trees or bushes. In forested areas of Fenno-Scandinavia and Russia, it occupies forest margins, clearings and clear fells. In the southern areas of its breeding range it occurs in rugged open mountainous areas with some shrubs up to 2,400 m asl (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011, BirdLife International 2015). The species arrives in the breeding areas from its wintering grounds in Africa from April. Eggs are laid from mid-April until early June. The species is mostly monogamous and pair-bonds last for one season. The nest is built by the female, often on the ground in a field of growing crops. The clutch consists of four or five eggs. The chicks hatch after 11–12 days, are tended by both parents and leave the nest after another 12–13 days. Autumn migration usually takes place from mid-August to mid-September (Madge 2011). During the breeding season the species mainly feeds on small invertebrates such as ants, beetles and grasshoppers, both on the ground and in bushes or the canopy of trees. Outside the breeding season it mainly forages on seeds (Madge 2011).;;The main pressure affecting populations of the species in Europe is the replacement of small-scale mixed farming by large-scale agricultural intensification, including the use of insecticides and herbicides. Ongoing conversion of relatively extensively used habitat to crop fields for biofuel is another issue. Other threats include isolation of the remaining populations (increased risk of extinction) as a consequence of habitat fragmentation as well as hunting and trapping of the species during migration (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Bernardy 2009).
B454;Emberiza_leucocephalos;"This species prefers forest edges, thinned out coniferous or mixed forests, forest-fragments and forest clearings as result of logging or fire (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). The small wintering grounds are mainly situated outside Europe, except for small wintering populations in France and Italy. In Toscana, in Italy it favours flat or gently undulating coastal dunes with herbs and shrubs and nearby groves of pines and in the Camargue, France it  winters in old sand dunes with shrub and tree cover that occur as islands in cultivated fields (Occhioato 2003). The species is migratory; leaving the breeding grounds in August and September and returning in late-March and April. The species breeds between late-April and the end of July, with most birds starting breeding in May. The nest is built by the female in vegetation on the ground. The clutch, usually four or five eggs, is incubated by the female and chicks hatch after 13 days. Nestlings are fed by both parents and they are fully fledged after 10–13 days (Copete 2011). During the breeding season the species mainly feeds on small invertebrates, such as grasshoppers, bugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, spiders and snails. Outside the breeding season it mainly forages on seeds of cereals, grasses and herbs (Copete 2011).";;Generally there is no evidence for substantial threats (BirdLife 2015). The species interbreeds with Emberiza citrinella in the contact zone of both species in the most western part of its range. According to Panov et al. (2003) the hybridisation process will intensify in the contact zone of both species, as they are very similar in behaviour and habitat choice. The long-term impact of this process is unclear (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Copete 2011, BirdLife 2015).
B464;Emberiza_melanocephala;This species breeds in open rather dry terrain with scattered trees, shrubs and hedges. It favours low-intensity farmland with cornfields or vineyards or olive groves, but also more natural habitats such as mountain slopes with scrub vegetation. It can occur op to 2,100 m Asl (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). The species returns to the breeding grounds in May and starts nesting from mid-May with a peak in June. The nest, built by the female, is placed in shrubs. The clutch, usually four to five eggs, is incubated by the female. The chicks hatch after 13–14 days. The nestling period is 14–16 days. The young birds stay near the nest for another three to four days, before they disperse.  The species leaves the breeding grounds in late June to early August (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). During the breeding season they mainly feed on invertebrates and to a lesser extent on seeds and other plant materials (Copete 2011).;;The population underwent a strong decline in Europe between 1970 and 1990 (BirdLife International 2004). The trend 1890–2011 is uncertain (BirdLife International 2015). It is likely that the long-term decline is related to the intensification of farming practices: scale-enlargement (destruction of hedgerows and shrubs), heavy pesticide use and changes in land-use: replacement of olive groves by maize fields and cornfields by commercial fruit-growing (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997).
B466;Emberiza_pallasi;"In its European breeding range this species inhabits zonal dwarf birch tundra in watersheds and on mountain slopes. In the polar Urals it occurs up to 300 m Asl. It normally occurs in drier and cooler regions than those favoured by Emberiza schoeniclus. Wintering grounds are situated outside Europe, mainly in China and Korea (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). Breeding takes place in June and July. The nest is placed on the ground or low in a bush. The clutch, usually three to five eggs, is incubated by the female. The incubation period is 11 days; nestlings are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 11 days. During the breeding season the species is reported to take seeds, beetles, caterpillars and also berries (Copete 2011).";;The population is suspected to be stable (BirdLife International 2015). Hunting of bunting flocks for food in its Chinese wintering range may be a threat to the species.  The melting of glaciers as a consequence of global warming may have adverse effects on the species's breeding habitat in the future (Copete 2011).
B461;Emberiza_pusilla;This species breeds in the northern taiga and tundra zone. It prefers moist, shrubby terrain and forests with dwarf birch and willow (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). The breeding season of this northern, migratory species is relatively late and starts in June. Some pairs are still nesting in August when autumn migration to the Asian wintering grounds has already started. The nest is built by the female, on the ground hidden under grassy vegetation. The clutch, usually four to six eggs are incubated by both sexes and hatch after 11–12 days. The chicks are raised by both parents and are fully fledged after 14–17 days (Copete 2011). The species feeds both on seeds and a variety of small invertebrate prey. Outside the breeding season it feeds predominantly on seeds (Copete 2011).;;BirdLife (2015) reports habitat shifting and alteration as a consequence of climate change as a future pressure for this species.
B462;Emberiza_rustica;"In the Scandinavian part of its range this species prefers mires dominated by spruce and birch and an undergrowth of shrubs and grasses. It also inhabits damp coniferous forests and birch dominated heaths interspersed with juniper. It may benefit from the construction of dams by beavers (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete and Garcia 2014, Dale & Hansen 2013). The breeding season starts late, ends May to early June. The nest is usually placed on the ground often near water, among grassy vegetation. Occasionally it is built in a low tree. The clutch, usually four to six eggs, is incubated by both the male and female. The chicks hatch after 11–13 days. They are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 7–10 days. Then they are fed by the parents for another 15 days before they are able to fly. The species is migratory; they leave the breeding grounds between late July and mid-September to travel to the wintering grounds in Asia. During the breeding season it mostly feeds on seeds and a wide variety of invertebrate species (Copete and Garcia 2014).";;The numbers of this species have declined in the Scandinavian part of its range since 1980. This decline is associated with forest logging and draining of swamps leading to habitat degradation or even destruction. However the habitat of the species in Norway where it has also declined has remained rather unchanged (Dale & Hansen 2013). It is suggested that habitat destruction and hunting and trapping, taking place in the east Asian wintering grounds, may be the cause of the species's decline in Norway.
B467;Emberiza_schoeniclus;Generally this species inhabits marshy areas with dense low vegetation types in (small) wetlands, such as fens, bogs, reed marshes, riversides and other inland waters. In Siberia it breeds in willow thickets in floodplains. In some regions the species has colonised drier habitats such as young woodland and farmland (maize, cereals and oil-seed rape fields) (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Copete 2011). Oil-seed rape fields have even become the most important breeding habitat for the species in lowland Britain (Gruar et al. 2006). The breeding season starts in early April and ends in August, depending on latitude and altitude. The species is mostly monogamous. The nest is built by the female, mostly on the ground, but sometimes in shrubs. The clutch, usually four or five eggs is incubated by both sexes. The chicks hatch after 12–15 days. They are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 9–12 days. The diet consists mainly of invertebrates during the breeding season and mainly seeds and other plant material at other times of the year. The species is partly migratory, in particular the northern and western European breeding birds, depending on the mean winter temperature. During the winter the species is also found in open fields, agricultural areas and woodland clearings (Copete 2011). Nowadays, in Central Europe it favours fallow and stubble fields overgrown with Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus forming important winter food sources for the species (Orlowki & Czarnecka 2007).;;Agricultural intensification is considered the main cause of the decline of the species in Europe and especially the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica (Vera et al. 2014). In particular the availability of winter food in farmland has declined as a consequence of crop change and the use of herbicides, resulting in the disappearance of weed-rich stubbles, and the use of advanced technologies reducing the amount of spilled grain (Peach et al. 1999, Orlowki & Czarnecka 2007). In addition the destruction of wetlands and unfavourable management (e.g. intensive reed cutting) is another important threat to the species, including the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica (Vera et al. 2014).
B468;Emberiza_calandra;In the northern part of its range this species is confined mainly to cereal fields and hay meadows. In southern Europe it has a broader habitat array occupying several types of open country, including grasslands and steppes. The species is mainly sedentary. During winter it gathers in flocks and may show rather short distance displacements to favourable feeding grounds, often fallow or stubble fields (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Bos & van Noorden 2010, Madge 2011). The breeding season starts relatively late, from late May onward in north-western populations, but probably earlier in southern European populations. The nest is placed on the ground, hidden among vegetation. It is entirely built by the female. The clutch, usually four to six eggs, is incubated by the female alone. The incubation period is 12–14 days. The chicks are fed by the female (with the male in attendance) and leave the nest after 9–13 often before being able to fly (Madge 2011). The species's diet consists mainly of plant seeds, but during the breeding season it includes a high percentage of invertebrates, primarily small insects (Madge 2011).;It avoids extensive bush cover. ;The strong decline of the species in north-western Europe is mainly a consequence of agricultural intensification. Cropped areas of spring-sown cereals have decreased, mowing of hay has been advanced and the use of pesticides has increased. Winter food supplies have decreased as a consequence of the loss of spring tillage, increased pesticide usage and improved harvesting and storage techniques. The increase of winter-sown cereal cropland has affected the species adversely through increased nest losses, as a consequence of early harvesting and the early ploughing of winter cereal stubble fields (Donald and Forrest 1995, Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011).The abolition of the European set-aside scheme is of great concern, not only for birds. Set-aside has provided valuable food and nesting sites for many farmland birds whose populations were declining due to agricultural intensification (BirdLife International 2008). The species may be vulnerable to climatic extremes along its northern range limits (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Madge 2011).
B470;Plectrophenax_nivalis;The species is found in treeless, uncultivated barren rocky terrain, usually near snow. It also uses sea cliffs and commonly nests near or even in human settlements. Outside the breeding season it occupies open fields, shingle beaches, saltmarshes, sand dunes, and stubble fields. In Greenland pair formation occurs by late May. It breeds from mid-May to July in Iceland and begins breeding in late May in Scotland. It is monogamous and the nest is a thick cup of dry grass and moss, lined with finer grasses, fur and feathers. It is sited in a variety of places, often in a crevice or crag in some rocks, but will also use artificial sites such as buildings and nestboxes. Clutches are two to eight eggs. The diet is primarily seeds but in the breeding season it will take small invertebrates. The species is migratory (Rising 2011).;;Declines in Europe of birds wintering in coastal areas of the southern North Sea since are attributed to huge embankment projects and intensified grazing, which have destroyed saltmarshes (the preferred foraging habitat of the species) (Rising 2011). The species is also likely threatened by future climate change (Virkkala et al. 2008).
B495;Bucanetes_githagineus;In Europe, this species uses areas without tree cover but with sparse scrub (less than 100 cm), including erosion-prone, poorly vegetated uncultivated areas. In the Canary Islands, it also nests on sandy plains with halophytic and xerophytic scrub (Tucker and Heath 1994). The breeding season is February to June and the species is monogamous. The nest is built by the female and is a loose collection of twigs, plant stalks, down and fibres, grass, animal hair and occasionally feathers. It is set in a shallow depression in the ground, under a rock, shrub or grass tussock, or up to six metres above ground in a pipe or the wall of a house, derelict building or old tomb. Clutches are four to six eggs. The diet is mostly small seeds, shoots and buds of grasses and low ground-loving plants as well as some insects and their larvae, mostly grasshoppers (Orthoptera) (Clement 2010). The species is resident and dispersive or nomadic (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In Europe the species is vulnerable owing to the small size and probable isolation of the population. Illegal trapping with nets at water sources is a problem in south-east Iberia (Tucker and Heath 1994) and poaching is widespread, affecting the whole Iberian distribution. In Spain it is also threatened by the spread of agriculture, urban development, reforestation and the abstraction of water (Madroño et al. 2004). In areas such as the Canary Islands, the development of the tourist industry and uncontrolled use of four-wheel-drive vehicles are a threat to its habitat (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B486;Linaria_cannabina;This species inhabits lowland open heaths and commons, moorlands and hills with scattered trees and light woodlands, open rocky hillsides, mountain slopes, alpine meadows and maquis or valleys with low shrubs. It is also found in woodland and forest clearings and edges, edges of cultivation, fallow fields, scrub and weed patches, plantations, orchards, vineyards, hedgerows, parks and large gardens. During the non-breeding season it also occupies coastal dunes, saltmarshes and shingle banks. Breeding occurs from mid-April to early August and it lays four to six eggs. The nest is built mostly from small twigs, plant fibres and down, roots, moss, animal fur and feathers and is placed low down, in dense bush or shrub, usually in a thorn bush or a hedge or conifer sapling. It feeds mainly on small to medium-sized seeds as well as buds and some invertebrates. The species is partially migratory except for southern European, Mediterranean and Atlantic island races which are entirely sedentary (Clement 2010).;;The species declined over much of central and north-west Europe in the late 20th century due to the intensification of agriculture, resulting in destruction of hedgerows, improved harvesting of cereals, and the eradication of fallow and weedy fields through application of herbicides (Clement 2010). It is not known if climatic factors are driving the southward range contraction in Finland (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B484;Carduelis_carduelis;This species inhabits open or sparse deciduous woodland and mixed deciduous and conifer woods, forest edges, thickets, heaths, hedgerows, streams, riverine and marshy areas with bushes and trees, roadside verges, steppe grasslands with scattered trees to edges of semi-desert areas, scrub, orchards, edges of cultivation and parks and gardens. Breeding occurs from April to early August. The nest is a compact small cup of grasses, moss, plant fibres and down, cobwebs, animal hair and feathers, a few aromatic flowers on outside, placed up to 10 m from the ground, concealed beneath foliage. Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds mostly on seeds (ripe and unripe), buds, flowers and the fruits of plants but also takes arthropods (Clement 2010). The species is partially migratory, wintering almost entirely within its breeding range and some Mediterranean populations may be sedentary (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The species is caught over most of its range and is popular as a cage bird (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B480;Chloris_chloris;This species inhabits a wide variety of habitats in boreal, temperate, steppe and Mediterranean zones, including the edges of lowland forest, deciduous and mixed forests, woods, plantations, copses and groves, orchards, churchyards, hedgerows, parks, edges of cultivation and gardens. Outside the breeding season it is found in similar habitats, but also in open fields, marshes and along the shoreline of open coasts. It breeds from mid-March to mid-August and is principally monogamous although occasionally polygamous. The nest is built 1–20 m from the ground in a bush, hedge, tree, creepers and occasionally in old or disused nests of other species or sometimes in an artificial site. It is a well-made cup of dry twigs, grasses, moss, lichens, plant fibres and down, animal hair, feathers and occasionally some man-made material. Clutches are four to six eggs. The diet is made up of a wide range of seeds, buds, flowers, berries and fruit as well as some arthropods. Some populations of the species are migratory while others are sedentary (Clement and de Juana 2013).;;The species has suffered significant declines in the U.K. from trichomonosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas gallinae, which lead to a fall in the population of ca. 35% between 2005 and 2010 (Lawson et al. 2012). The species is trapped in some parts of its range.
B490;Carduelis_citrinella;This species is generally found in montane and submontane woods of spruce (Picea), larch (Larix) and pine (Pinus), usually along the edges and in clearings. It also inhabits scattered clumps of conifers in otherwise open areas, as well as alpine meadows, ski-runs, roadside edges, and around alpine huts and gardens in towns. In the non-breeding season it is found in similar habitats in sheltered valleys at lower levels. Breeding begins at the end of March to mid-April and continues until August. The nest is a cup of dry grass, plant fibres, lichens, animal hair, feathers and occasionally wool or paper and usually placed up to 30 m above the ground against the trunk of a tall tree or at the tip of strong horizontal branches. Clutches are three to five eggs (Clement and de Juana 2013). It feeds on small to medium sized seeds and sometimes green material from a wide range of plants and some insects (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is a partial short-distance migrant and an altitudinal migrant (Clement and de Juana 2013).;;This species is threatened by the future effects of climate change (Maggini et al. 2014).
B481;Acanthis_flammea;In the north of this species's range it breeds in lowland treeless tundra and dry heath with dwarf birch (Betula) and stunted shrubby osiers (Salix), as well as open taiga of pine (Pinus) and spruce (Picea) and scrub. Further south it prefers wooded slopes, swampy hollows and riverine thickets with birch, willow (Salix), juniper (Juniperus), alder (Alnus) and rowan (Sorbus), along with mixed birch and pine. In Iceland it also breeds in introduced conifer plantations and parks. Breeding occurs from late-April to August. Nests are generally built up to five metres above ground in a shrub or tree and frequently on branches close to the trunk and are a cup constructed of grasses, small twigs, plant fibres and roots, bark strips, moss, animal hair and feathers. Clutches are four to six eggs. it feeds mainly on seeds and buds, as well as small invertebrates (Clement 2010) which are usually taken in the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). In northern Europe small numbers are resident but most migrate to non-breeding grounds in Fennoscandia and European Russia (Clement 2010).;;In Poland afforestation and disturbance from recreational activities pose a threat (Jakubiec 2001). This species may also be affected by future climate change (Marthinsen et al. 2008).
B485;Linaria_flavirostris;This species breeds on lower montane and submontane plateaux, open moorland, barren hillsides, scree slopes, boulder-strewn areas with little or sparse vegetation, steppes, alpine meadows and areas with stunted bushes and often near boggy areas. Race pipilans breeds mostly on grassy hillsides and moorlands with heather (Erica) and bracken (Pteridium) and also in coastal heather in Scotland (including Shetland). Outside of the breeding season it occupies similar open habitat at lower altitudes. The breeding season is from April to August. The nest is a compact, deep cup of plant fibres and roots, mostly heather, bracken, grass, moss, animal hair and feathers. It is generally sited on the ground or very low down within three metres of the ground in dwarf willow (Salix), heather, bilberry (Vaccinium), bracken, rushes or grass tussocks. Clutches are three to six eggs. The diet is made up mostly of seeds and buds and small numbers of invertebrates. The species is generally migratory although some populations are resident (Clement 2010).;;In Scotland, declines are thought to have been caused by overgrazing and agricultural expansion, (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Clement 2010) and changes in agricultural management causing habitat degradation and fragmentation. In addition climatic factors may have an impact on the species, influencing warmer or drier summers.  In the Waddenzee area of the North Sea coast the development of large embankments and increased grazing is thought to have driven declines (Clement 2010). Changes in land use and overgrazing also pose a threat in Ireland (McLoughlin 2009).
B483;Spinus_spinus;This species breeds in boreal and temperate lowland, submontane and montane conifer forests, mainly spruce (Picea), and in fairly open mixed deciduous and conifer forests, including fir (Abies) and pine (Pinus). It also frequents a wide variety of other trees, including larch (Larix), alder (Alnus) and birch (Betula), together with non-native conifers in plantations, parks and gardens. It is found in similar habitats outside the breeding season as well as on heaths, commons, orchards, weedy thickets, parks and gardens. The breeding season begins late February or March and runs until August and the timing is dependent on the cone crop. The nest is a small ball of conifer twigs, bark strips, plant fibres, roots and down, heather, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair, feathers and cobwebs and is placed against the trunk or in the outer branches of a tall tree, up to 20 m above ground. It lays three to five eggs (Clement 2010). It feeds principally on seeds, particularly of conifers, alder, birch and herbs and in the breeding season it also takes invertebrates. Northern populations are mostly migratory while some southern populations are resident (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In some areas the species fluctuates significantly due to irregular resource availability (Clement 2010).
B474;Carpodacus_erythrinus;"This species is found in lowland to montane moist forests, woodlands and thickets of willows (Salix), alder (Alnus), poplar (Populus), tamarisks (Tamarix), scrub and bushes in taiga forest edges and clearings. It also occurs in riverine thickets, reedbeds and patches of bushes in meadows, forest edges, hedges, orchards, cherry (Prunus) trees and the edges of cultivation. In forest-steppe and higher areas of montane foothills it found in bracken (Pteridium), dwarf willows, juniper (Juniperus) and on bush-covered slopes with isolated birch (Betula) and firs (Abies).

The breeding season is from May to August and the species in monogamous. The nest is a loose or untidy cup of twigs, plant stems and fibres, grass, flowerheads, plant down, moss, lichens and animal hair. It is set low down in a bush, juniper or spruce or willow sapling and is well hidden in a tangle of foliage or against a trunk, occasionally in scrub tangle . Clutches are four to six eggs. The diet is mainly plant and tree seeds, buds, catkins, shoots, leaves, fruit and berries but it will also take nectar, insects and their larvae and other arthropods (Clement and Christie 2013). The species is migratory, with most populations being long-distance migrants (Snow and Perrins 1998).";and rarely on the ground;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B475;Carpodacus_rubicilla;This species is found in alpine and subalpine areas with stunted and sparse vegetation, montane and submontane plateaux, usually above the rhododendron (Rhododendron) zone, in barren, desolate and windswept hillsides, around rock faces and valleys with occasional dwarf birch (Betula), juniper (Juniperus) and willow (Salix) thickets and boulder-strewn and rock-strewn screes. It also occupies the edges of glaciers and ice-fields, alpine meadows, and open fields at edges of cultivation. Outside of the breeding season it is found at lower levels in similar habitat (Clement 2010). In Europe breeding is from July to August (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The nest is constructed mainly from thin twigs, plants stalks and root fibres, grass, moss, animal hair, wool and feathers. It is set in a crevice in a rock face or in a low bush on cliff face and exceptionally in a deserted building. Clutches are four to five eggs. The diet is chiefly seeds, buds, shoots and flowers of small alpine plants but it sometimes takes berries and small insects as well. The species is resident and an altitudinal migrant, moving to lower levels from October to March (Clement 2010).;;In Europe, declines are attributed to the destruction of habitats rich in Sea Buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) scrub and predation by Alpine Couch (Pyrrhocorax graculus) (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). During the winter and increasing number of the species are being trapped as cagebirds (Tucker and Heath 1994). The size of the European population could also render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations (Birdlife International 2004).
B493;Coccothraustes_coccothraustes;"This species prefers broadleaved forest, in particular oak-hornbeam, and also mixed forest. Besides more natural forests it also occupies parks and gardens, (cherry) orchards and olive groves in some areas of its range. In the drier southern parts of its range it inhabits steppe-woodlands and thorn thickets. It breeds up to 1,300 m in central Europe and up to 2,200 m asl in the Caucasus (Hagemeijer & Blair 1997, Calladine & Morrison 2010, Collar et al. 2010). Although northern populations of the species are partly migratory, it is resident in large parts of its European range. Short distance seasonal movements can take place, depending on food availability. Generally it breeds between March and mid-August.

The species is monogamous, forming pair-bonds for more than one year. It occasionally breeds in small colonies. The nest is built by both parents, in a tree up to 14 m. The clutch size is normally three to five eggs but may be even larger in some areas with optimal habitat conditions. The eggs are incubated by the female for 11–13 days. The chicks are reared by both parents and leave the nest after 11–13 days and become independent after about 30 days (Hagemeijer& Blair 1997, Collar et al. 2010, Tomiałojć 2012). The diet of the species consists predominantly of seeds, buds and shoots of trees and shrubs. In particular the nestlings are fed by small invertebrates. Food is collected at all levels in trees and also on the ground (Collar et al. 2010).";;Generally there is no evidence for substantial threats. Since the 1990s the species has expanded its European range. Now the population is suspected to be stable. Declines in some countries are possibly related to destruction of deciduous forest, removal of old orchards and increased predation (Collar et al. 2010, BirdLife International 2015).
B496;Bucanetes_mongolicus;This species inhabits montane and submontane, arid, desolate and semi-desert areas with slopes, cliffs, screes, ravines and steep valleys, as well as open stony, sandy areas with grassy patches or low scrub (e.g. Caragana). It is also occasionally found on the edge of alpine meadows and cultivated fields. It occupies similar habitats at lower altitudes outside of the breeding season. It breeds from mid-April to late July or August and lays four to six eggs. The nest is a loose foundation of twigs, plant stalks, down and fibres, leaves, grass and animal hair. It is usually placed in a shallow saucer or depression on the ground, under a low bush or grass tussock, in scree slope, between rocks or boulders, in crevice or niche in cliff or rock face, or in the wall of a building, well or ruin. The diet is mainly small seeds, but buds and shoots are also taken (Clement 2010). The species makes short-distance and altitudinal migratory movements (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"The size of the European population makes it vulnerable to the risks faced by small populations; however it is adjacent to a large non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B471;Fringilla_coelebs;This species inhabits lowland and lower montane deciduous, mixed and conifer woods with a slight preference for beech (Fagus), hornbeam (Carpinus), mature oak (Quercus), spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus). It also uses forest edges and glades, copses, heaths, edges of tundra and agricultural areas, hedgerows, orchards, parks and gardens. In the Canary Islands it is found in laurel (Lauraceae) forest and areas of dense vegetation (Clement 2010). Egg-laying occurs mainly from late-April to mid-July but clutches can be found from mid-March to mid-July (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is placed up to 35 m above ground on a branch, against a trunk or in the fork of a tree or bush. It is a deep cup made of plant fibres, grass, fine roots, lichens, moss, bark strips, animal hair and feathers. Clutches are four to five eggs. The diet is varied and is mostly small invertebrates and their larvae, seeds and buds. The species is resident, partially migratory and migratory, with populations in the north and northeast moving south and southwest between mid-September and the end of November (Clement 2010).;;Particularly in northern areas populations may fluctuate in response to weather conditions, with cold conditions resulting in temporary declines (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is trapped in some parts of its range. In the Canary Islands the race palmae is threatened by forest fires, wood harvesting and predation by introduced mammals, while race ombriosa is threatened by forest fires, wood harvesting and drought (Madroño and González 2004).
B472;Fringilla_montifringilla;This species breeds in birch (Betula) and conifer woodland and also in mixed deciduous and conifer woods. Along the northern edge of the tundra it occurs in dwarf birch and willow (Salix) scrub and farther south in riverine alder (Alnus). During the non-breeding season it is found mainly in areas of deciduous trees, including woods, forests and small copses and shelter-belts, especially those containing beech (Fagus) or hornbeam (Carpinus), along edges of open agricultural fields, as well as in weedy and stubble fields and orchards. It breeds from May to early August and is monogamous. The nest is built above ground in a fork or against the trunk of a tree, or exceptionally low down in scrub or on the ground. It is a large, loose cup of grass, heather, birch or juniper bark strips, moss, lichens, plant down, animal hair or fur, feathers and cobwebs, sometimes with pieces of string or paper added. Normally lays five to seven eggs (Clement and Arkhipov 2010). It feeds on seeds and berries and in the summer on invertebrates as well. In its winter quarters it specialises in beechnuts (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, although a small number in Scandinavia are resident (Clement and Arkhipov 2010).;;Birds in subalpine Fennoscandia vary annually, apparently alongside the abundance of caterpillars of autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) (Clement and Arkhipov 2010).
B510;Fringilla_teydea;"It is largely dependent on Canary pine (Pinus canariensis) and will inhabit reforested areas where these fall within the natural distribution of this tree. During the breeding season, it is found in pinewoods at 1,000–2,000 m with a high proportion of broom (Chamaecytisus proliferus) in the understorey (Garcia-del-Rey et al. 2009). It has been recorded from 800 to 2,300 m at other times.

The breeding season lasts from April to early August. The nest is built by the female mostly from pine twigs, tree-heath or broom, plant fibres and down, pine needles, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair, feathers and cobwebs. Generally it is placed up to 12 m above ground against trunk of Canary pine and sometimes in laurel or heather (Clement 2010). Two eggs are normally laid. Although Canary pine seeds constitute its main food source, birds occasionally feed outside pinewoods during severe weather. The species selects sheltered sites for feeding during the non-breeding period with the selection of less sheltered sites mediated by pine seed availability (Garcia-del-Rey et al. 2009). The species is resident although vagrants occur on Lanzarote in the east of the Canary Isles (Clement 2010).";;It suffers from being captured and kept in cages, and possibly also still from illegal trade, primarily to Italy, Germany and Belgium, which may have an effect on population levels. Its pinewood habitat has been subject to intense commercial exploitation which has resulted in habitat fragmentation and population isolation, particularly on Gran Canaria. Forest fires have been important in the destruction of pinewoods on Gran Canaria, most recently in the summer of 2007 when significant areas were destroyed including one of the most important sites on Gran Canaria. Protected areas are heavily used for recreation and leisure on Gran Canaria and this may cause disturbance. Inbreeding may also be a significant threat in the Gran Canaria population (Barov and Derhé 2011). The main cause of breeding failure is predation, mostly by the Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) (Rodríguez and Moreno 2008).
B478;Loxia_curvirostra;"This is a species of lowland to submontane conifer forests and woodlands. Northern Palearctic populations are mostly found in taiga forests of spruce (Picea) and southern breeders (southern Britain south to the Mediterranean region) in pines (Pinus), including Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Race guillemardi occupies black pine (Pinus nigra) and race corsicana occurs in cultivated Corsican pine (P.n. larico).  It also uses larch (Larix), cedar (Cedrus), alder (Alnus) and birch (Betula). On passage and in the non-breeding season it occurs in pine and deciduous trees in coastal woodlands, parks and gardens, including in suburban areas and city centres, also exceptionally along tideline. 

The breeding season is generally determined by food abundance but is typically from August to April/May in northern and central Europe, mid-January to mid-May in Scandinavia, February to mid-May in northern Russia and March to early November in Cyprus. The nest is a deep cup of conifer twigs, bark or rotting wood strips, plant fibres, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair and feathers. It is sited 3–35 m above the ground, usually beneath the outermost foliage, close to the crown of a tall conifer and often close to the trunk in a spruce or along the branch of a pine. Clutches are three to four eggs. The species is resident and a partial migrant and is commonly irruptive and nomadic in the non-breeding season (Clement and Christie 2014).";;In Finland, the species has declined due to forest fragmentation. This is principally as a result of overall shortening of rotation times leading to a reduction in the average age of forests (Clement and Christie 2014).
B479;Loxia_leucoptera;This species occupies dense conifer forests and plantations, mainly larch and larch-pine (Larix-Pinus) forests. It is found predominantly with Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) in central Siberia and also uses fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea), and occasionally resorts to deciduous trees in absence of preferred conifers. In eastern Russia it is mostly found in larches and mainly in Spruce and in north-west Russia and Scandinavia mostly in spruce (Clement 2010). The breeding season is from February to mid-May in years of a good seed crop of pine and spruce, but in poor crop years it is delayed to from June to August (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is constructed mostly of conifer twigs, plant stalks, grass stems, lichens, moss, plant fibres and down, animal hair or fur and feathers. It is set 2–20 m above ground against the trunk of a conifer, typically spruce. On occasion it is placed at the end of a branch. Clutches are three to four eggs. The diet consists mainly of conifer seeds, buds, berries and shoots, chiefly of larch and spruce but it also takes a range of invertebrates and larvae (Clement 2010). The species is resident and dispersive but also eruptive in years of poor seed crops (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B476;Loxia_pytyopsittacus;This is a species of lowland pine forests and woodlands. It is found predominantly in tall, mature and open woodlands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and occasionally in mixed conifer forests with larch (Larix), spruce (Picea) and rowan (Sorbus). It also occurs in coastal shelter-belts and introduced conifer plantations, usually of large-coned species. On passage and in wintering areas may occur more widely in mixed conifer and deciduous woodlands. The breeding season runs from December to late June and it generally lays three to four eggs. The nest is constructed mostly of dry conifer twigs, bark strips, pine needles, grass, leaves, moss, lichens, plant fibres and down, animal hair or fur, and sometimes also some feathers. It is normally placed close to the trunk, on a branch or in a fork up to 20 m above ground in a conifer at the woodland edge. It feeds mostly on seeds, buds and shoots, commonly of pines (particularly Scots pine) and spruce (Clement 2010). The species is resident and dispersive and also occasionally eruptive (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The population is thought to have declined near the end of the 20th century as a result of the commercial removal of mature pine trees, which affected amount and distribution of conifer seed (Clement 2010).
B477;Loxia_scotica;This species breeds in lowland forests and stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), including open mature plantations and ancient relict forest trees. During the winter it is mostly found in larches (Larix) and in established plantations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) as well as well-spaced pine woodland with heather (Calluna) understorey. Breeding occurs from January or February to June and the species is monogamous, although occasional polygamy is recorded. The nest is a large bulky cup of twigs (mostly pine, larch or birch), heather, grass, plant fibres, bark strips, moss, lichens, animal hair, leaves and feathers. It is sited six to eight metres above the ground in the upper level of old Scots pine, usually high in the crown or at the end of a spreading branch and very occasionally built in spruce, larch or Douglas-fir. Clutches are three to four eggs. The diet is mainly made up of seeds of Scots pine (bill shape thought to be better adapted for feeding on cones of this species) and when these are unavailable, it takes seeds, blossom, buds and shoots of larch (Larix), spruce (Picea), fir (Abies), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga) and beech (Fagus), and possibly small invertebrates. The species is resident and locally dispersive (Clement and de Juana 2013).;;Suitable semi-natural habitat has declined from approximately 15,000 km2 to fragments totalling 160 km2 over the last 5,000 years. However, the amount of plantation woodland has increased substantially during the 20th century (Clement and de Juana 2013). Habitat may also be degraded through underplanting with exotic conifers and grazing pressure from high numbers of red deer, which prevents forest regeneration (Tucker and Heath 1994). Climate change may be a threat to the species, through driving changes in habitat, however the provision of habitat through commercial forestry may play a role in mitigating this (Summers and Buckland 2011).
B473;Pinicola_enucleator;"This species inhabits lowland, lower montane and subarctic conifer forests and woods, including larch (Larix), spruce (Picea), cedar (Cedrus) and fir (Abies). It is also found along the tree-line of northern taiga. It occupies mixed deciduous and conifer, in light or open forest, often along forest edge, on hillsides, in clearings and in damp or marshy areas. In the non-breeding season more widely found in deciduous woods, willow thickets and copses in valleys and woodland patches at edges of cultivation, including orchards, as well as mixed scrub, parks and suburban gardens.

The bird breeds from May to July. The nest is a deep untidy or loose cup built mostly of juniper, spruce, birch or pine twigs and occasionally with plant fibres, pine needles, grass, lichen filaments, moss, animal hair and feathers. It is usually placed two to six metres from the ground close to or against the trunk of a tree, in pine, spruce, juniper or birch, and often well hidden in densest part of the tree. Clutches are three or four. It feeds principally on seeds, buds, shoots and small fruits and takes some invertebrates. The species is resident and a partial migrant and is occasionally irruptive (Clement 2010).";;In central Finland, declines during the latter part of 20th century, may be due to large-scale deforestation (Clement 2010). The species may also be threatened by changes in habitats driven by climate change (Virkkala et al. 2013a).
B492;Pyrrhula_murina;This species appears to depend on the native laurissilva forest during the winter and spring, although seeds from the exotic Clethra arborea may be a critical food in December and January (Ceia et al. 2011b). In the summer and autumn (May–November) its habitat use is more conservative, and birds utilise bare ground, vegetation less than 2 m high and also forest margins. Exotic vegetation such as plantations of Japanese red cedar Cryptomeria japonica within 200 m of native forest is also used during summer (Ceia et al. 2009). Birds breed from mid-June to late August, with a clutch size of three eggs (Teodósio et al. 2009). The nest is a cup of twigs, dry grass, plant fibres and moss, placed up to 5 m above ground in conifer, usually cedar (Clement and Christie 2013). The diet comprises of at least 37 different plants of which 13 are known to be important (Ramos 1995). The species appears entirely dependent on native forest for food during many months of the year (Ramos 1995, Ceia et al. 2011). This species is resident but movements of up to 5.8 km between native forest patches have been recorded as birds move to feed on ripening seeds (Ceia 2008).;;The historical decline and its extremely small range are believed to be a consequence of the widespread clearance of native forest for forestry plantations and agriculture. The spread of alien invasive plant species (especially Hedychium gardnerianum, Clethra arborea and Pittosporum undulatum), which have largely overrun the remaining patches of natural vegetation, suppress the natural fruit, seed and bud food supply to the species (G. Hilton in litt. 2006). The species exhibits a preference for non-invaded laurel forest habitat (Ceia et al. 2011), and is entirely absent from highly invaded areas (e.g. P. undulatum copses (Ceia et al. 2009)). Food shortages are potentially a problem throughout the year, but are most severe in late winter (Ceia et al. 2011b). Random environmental and demographic factors can affect such small populations and inbreeding may reduce reproductive output. Predation by introduced rats and mustelids may also be affecting nesting success (G. Hilton in litt. 2006, Ceia 2008, Teodósio et al. 2009).
B491;Pyrrhula_pyrrhula;"This species inhabits lowland and lower montane deciduous forest and woodlands, thickets and copses, as well as heaths, hedgerows and scrubby areas, parks and the edges of cultivation, including orchards and gardens in towns and cities. It occurs mostly in conifers and mixed and broadleaf forest in Siberia and other parts of Russia . In the Caucasus it favours in pine (Pinus) and tall beech (Fagus) forest, while in northern Europe it prefers conifer forests with well-developed undergrowth of spruce (Picea), cedar (Cedrus), larch (Larix), also birch (Betula) and yew (Taxus).

The breeding season is typically from late April to mid-September. The nest is generally constructed of dry grass, plant fibres, roots, moss, lichen and leaves set on a loose base of dry twigs and placed up to five metres from the ground in thick bush, brambles and honeysuckle or on a flat low branch of a conifer. Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds on a range of seeds, buds and shoots of various plants, as well as some invertebrates (Clement and Christie 2013). The species is sedentary to migratory, with most populations likely being partially migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;Since the late 1970s numbers have declined in Britain owing to changes in agricultural practice, which is thought to adversely affected supply of weed seeds (Clement and Christie 2013). The exact mechanisms, which link land-use change and declines of the species, are poorly understood however (Siriwardena et al. 2001).
B497;Rhodospiza_obsoleta;This species is found in lowland and submontane dry, arid and semi-arid areas of open plains, semi-deserts and wadis with sparse vegetation, low scrub, thickets and scattered trees. It also occurs in irrigated areas and on the edges of cultivation, particularly orchards and vineyards. The species is monogamous and both sexes build the nest which is an untidy cup constructed mostly of twigs, plant stalks, fibres and down and occasionally also animal hair or fur and scraps of cloth. It is set in the fork of a branch in a shrub or low tree, in semi-desert areas usually tamarisk (Tamarix) or Arthrophytum, in agricultural areas often in orchard and then in Prunus, vine (Vitis) or pistachio (Pistacia) and also in eucalypt (Eucalyptus), acacia (Acacia) or pine (Pinus), poplar (Populus), elm or mulberry (Morus). Clutches are four to six eggs. The diet is mostly small seeds, buds and shoots but it also takes some insects (Clement 2010). The species is mainly sedentary in Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B494;Rhodopechys_sanguineus;The species breeds on montane and submontane slopes and in high-level valleys (Clement 2010). It is generally found on stony slopes and ridges with sparse arid scrub and herbage, in the scrub and juniper zone above the trees and on almost bare, dry, eroded clay hills. It winters at lower altitudes on bare areas and arable cultivation (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from April to mid-July. The nest is a neat, loose cup of dry grasses, cereals, plant stems and fibres and sometimes animal hair. It is placed on stony ground on a scree slope, under an overhanging rock, in lava or in a crevice, grass tussock or thorn-scrub, or occasionally in a low bush, on a cliff ledge or in the wall of a derelict house. Clutches are four to five eggs. It feeds mainly on small seeds, buds and the shoots of grasses, semi-desert and alpine plants. It also takes some insects. The species is an altitudinal and short-distance migrant (Clement 2010).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B489;Serinus_canaria;The species inhabits a wide variety of lowland and submontane forests of pine (Pinus), laurel (Lauraceae), the edges of cultivation and wooded valleys (barrancos) with almonds (Prunus), tamarisk (Tamarix) thickets, myrtle (Myrica) hedges, tree-heaths (Erica) and especially areas of broom (Cytisus) It is also found in parks and gardens and on Desertas (Madeira) it breeds in open semi-arid areas with little or no vegetation cover. Breeding occurs from January to July and it is monogamous. The nest is a deep compact cup made of twigs, plant fibres and down, grass, moss and lichens, small leaves, animal hair (mainly sheep wool) and feathers, sited above ground in a fork at the end of a thin branch or in the crown of a small tree. Clutches are three to four eggs. It feeds mainly on seeds, particularly of herbs and grasses, as well as buds and fruit and a small number of insects. The species is resident, undertaking short-distance dispersive movements (Clement 2010).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B487;Serinus_pusillus;The species breeds in montane and submontane forests of birch (Betula), pine (Pinus), juniper (Juniperus), spruce (Picea), willows (Salix) and larch (Larix), usually at or towards edge of forest. It also uses areas of dwarf junipers and scattered barberry (Berberis) scrub on open hillsides and above the tree-line, rhododendrons (Rhododendron), scree slopes, alpine and subalpine meadows, ravines and the upper edges of steep valleys. Outide the breeding season it is found in similar habitats as well as orchards and gardens at edges of human settlements, scattered trees on hillsides with low scrub, river valleys, rocky wadis and edges of cultivation. It breeds from April to August and usually lays three to five eggs. The nest is a neat, compact cup of dry grasses, strips of bark, plant fibres and down, moss, lichen, feathers and cobwebs, placed low down in bush or higher on branch or in fork, or against trunk, or on rock crevice, cliff ledge or in a hole in scree (Clement 2010). It feeds mainly on seeds, fruits and other plant material and sometimes takes small insects. The species is resident and an altitudinal migrant (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B488;Serinus_serinus;"This species occurs in lowland to lower montane mosaics of wooded hills with conifers and open country, maquis slopes with pine (Pinus) woods, small stands of cedars (Cedrus), junipers (Juniperus), cypress, European silver fir (Abies alba) and thuja (Thuja). It is also widespread in olive (Olea) and citrus groves, open agricultural areas, tall hedges and windbreaks, orchards, vineyards, plantations, suburban parks, avenues and gardens, ravines and gorges with trees and shrubs. The breeding season runs from February to early August. The nest is sited above ground among the outermost branches in the crown or on a branch against trunk of a bush or tree. It is a small and compact platform of small twigs, plant stems and down, bark strips, roots, grasses, moss, animal hair and feathers. Clutches are three to four eggs. It feeds mainly on seeds, buds, shoots, flowers and small invertebrates (Clement 2010). The species is sedentary to migratory; most birds vacate the northern part of its range, although in some years small numbers remain (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B309;Delichon_urbicum;This species occupies open areas, coastal cliffs, cultivation, and human habitations, including towns and cities. In north-west and central Europe, egg-laying occurs from May and in northern and north-east Europe from the end of May. In southern Spain laying occurs from March to May. The nest is built by both sexes and is enclosed with a small entrance hole near the top. It is made of mud pellets, lined with vegetable fibres and feathers and is attached to the outside of a building or, less often, a bridge, usually under an overhang and sometimes inside buildings. . Clutches are normally three to five eggs. It feeds almost entirely on flying insects, almost always taken by aerial-pursuit (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, with European birds wintering south of the Sahara (Turner 2004).;It will also occasionally use a natural sea cliff or rock face  and rarely a cave or tree (Turner 2004);The species is affected by adverse weather which can have significant impacts during breeding and migration. It is also thought to compete for nest sites with House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and a study conducted in Poland attributed recent changes in breeding sites to this (Turner 2004).
B308;Cecropis_daurica;This species is found in open hilly country and mountains, river gorges, valleys, sea cliffs, as well as in cultivated areas and human habitations, including towns. In Europe, breeding occurs from April to September and is usually solitary although sometimes in loose groups.  The nest is built by both sexes and is enclosed with a tunnel entrance. It is made of mud pellets sometimes mixed with a little dry grass and lined with a mixture of white feathers, hair, plant down, leaves, pine (Pinus) needles or dry grass. Clutch size varies regionally but is normally four or five in Europe (Turner 2004). The species feeds on insects, taking airborne prey in aerial pursuit (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory and European populations are thought to winter in the savanna zone of the northern Afrotropics (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;The species may be threatened by competition with other birds which use its nests (Martí and del Moral 2004).
B306;Ptyonoprogne_rupestris;This species is found on mountains, crags and coastal cliffs and also around human habitations. It breeds from May to August. Both sexes build the nest which is an open half-cup made of mud pellets, lined with grass and feathers and the female continues to add lining during incubation. It is placed in a crevice or under an overhang on a cliff face and also sometimes on a bridge or on or in a building. Clutches are generally two to five eggs (Turner 2004). It feeds on insects, usually taken in flight. Northern populations of this species are migratory while elsewhere it is resident, only making altitudinal movements (Snow and Perrins 1998) and post-breeding movements (Turner and Rose 1989).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B307;Hirundo_rustica;This species breeds in a wide range of climates and over a wide altitudinal range, preferring open country such as farmland where buildings provide nesting sites and where water is nearby. In Europe it is superseded by the House Martin (Delichon urbicum) in urban areas (Turner and Rose 1989). In Britain and Western Europe, egg-laying begins late April or early May but occurs up to two weeks later in Scandinavia and one week earlier in southern Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is built by both sexes and is a cup or half-cup, made from mud pellets mixed with fibres such as dry grass, straw and horsehair and lined with dry grass and white feathers. Originally nests were built in caves or on cliffs but now almost always on artificial structures. Clutches are two to seven eggs (Turner and Christie 2012). It feeds almost entirely on flying insects (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), although some individuals winter in southern and western Europe each year (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The main threat to the species is the intensification of agriculture. Changes in farming practices such as the abandonment of traditional milk and beef production have resulted in a loss of suitable foraging areas. In addition, intensive livestock rearing, improved hygiene, land drainage and the use of herbicides and pesticides all reduce the numbers of insect prey available. Suitable nest sites are often scarcer on modern farms. The species is susceptible to changes in climate with bad weather in the wintering areas as well as the breeding grounds affecting breeding success (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is occasionally hunted for sport and nests are sometimes removed as a nuisance (Turner and Christie 2012).
B305;Riparia_riparia;The species nests colonially in newly eroded banks of rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and coastal cliffs (Tucker and Heath 1994, Turner 2004). Quarries are important nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and birds may use other man-made habitats including road and railway cuttings and building work excavations. Breeding occurs between late April and August usually with two clutches of between three and six eggs. Burrows are excavated by both male and female but male initiates the process. Erosion at breeding sites is vital for creating new nest sites which birds prefer. Sand martins may roost in reedbeds. They forage approximately 15 m above ground (Turner 2004) feeding mainly on insects but also taking spiders (Tucker & Heath 1994, Turner 2004). Important foraging habitats include water-bodies, grassland and farmland (Turner 2004). Urban and forested areas are less important. This species is migratory with Eurasian birds typically wintering in the Sahel zone and East Africa south to Mozambique (Tucker and Heath 1994). Adult birds migrate soon after breeding. Juveniles roam over a wide area. Most adult birds return to the same breeding colony in subsequent years (Turner 2004).;;Breeding sites are generally ephemeral and can often be lost through human activities (e.g. flood control, erosion control on rivers). In Europe, it is often dependent on artificial breeding sites such as quarries (Turner 2004), however quarry work can adversely affect breeding, though workers often take measures to prevent this. The use of pesticides causing declines in prey species, may impact the species (Tucker and Heath 1994). In the past droughts in wintering areas have caused severe large-scale population declines in western Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Turner 2004).
B433;Lanius_collurio;The species breeds in temperate and Mediterranean climates (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997). It requires sunny, warm, usually dry, and level or gently sloping terrain, with scattered bushes, shrubs or low trees providing hunting posts overlooking areas of short grass, heath or bare soil. High-quality habitats tend to feature mosaic-like grassy vegetation with alternating areas of tall and short growth and bare areas, with perches. In agricultural areas occupies neglected overgrown patches, heaths, open downs, overgrown orchards and gardens, hedgerows, and scrub along railways or roadsides. It is found also in temporary steppe-like habitats, such as military training areas, burned forests, forest clearings and spruce (Picea) plantations (Yosef et al. 2012). Egg-laying occurs from May to July (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997) and clutches are generally three to seven eggs. The untidy-looking nest is  a loose foundation of often green plant stems, roots, grass, lichen, hair, or similar, compactly lined with grass, hair, moss, fur, reed (Phragmites) or reedmace (Typha) flowerheads, plant down and similar material, situated in dense, often thorny bush such as hawthorn (Crataegus), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), bramble (Rubus) or dog-rose (Rosa) (Yosef et al. 2012). It is an opportunistic feeder, feeding mostly on insects and other invertebrates as well as small mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The species is migratory, wintering in eastern and southern Africa (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997).;;Declines are probably due mainly to the loss and fragmentation of habitat resulting from afforestation and agricultural intensification, and the increased use of pesticides causing loss of food resources (Yosef et al. 2012). The heavy application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer causing the earlier and denser growth of vegetation may also be a threat (Tucker and Heath 1994). In northern and western edges of range, its breeding is affected by cooler, wetter summers (Yosef et al. 2012).
B434;Lanius_excubitor;The species breeds in subarctic and temperate climates in open country with trees, bushes, fence posts and powerlines. Northern populations also use clearings in taiga or in the transition zone from taiga to tundra and forest edge. It is sometimes found on marshland and peat bogs. Sparse and low vegetation is an important habitat characteristic for this species (Yosef et al. 2008). The beginning of egg-laying varies with latitude (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997) but is generally from March to June in Europe. The nest is built by both sexes and is a well-made structure with a loose foundation of twigs, grass, rootlets, string, lined with rootlets, feathers and hair. It is generally placed high above ground in a fork or on a lateral branch of a tree, often pine (Pinus) or poplar (Populus) or sometimes in dense shrub. Clutches in Europe are usually six or seven eggs (Yosef et al. 2008). It feeds principally on small vertebrates such as small rodents, particularly voles, but also small birds, lizards, amphibians and large insects (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997). European populations migrate south to below 60° N but many of those breeding in south-west Europe appear largely sedentary (Yosef et al. 2008).;;Habitat for this species has been destroyed and degraded by agricultural intensification. The removal of hedges and trees has reduced the number of available hunting perches and nest sites and reduced food availability. Wide scale use of herbicides and pesticides has also reduced the prey availability. However the cessation of agricultural activity can also have negative impacts, such as the removal of sheep-grazing may lead to the invasion of scrub, resulting in unsuitable habitat for the species. Destruction of peatbogs with scattered pines is thought to explain declines around Moscow. It may also be adversely affected by bad weather and harsh winters. It is also threatened by the development of industry and road building and disturbance from humans, cars and dogs can increase predation by corvids (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B436;Lanius_minor;"This species occurs in open lowlands and hills in steppe and forest-steppe and Mediterranean zones. Suitable breeding habitats in Europe include orchards, groves, parks, woodland edges and overgrown ditches even if close to human settlement or cultivation (Tucker and Heath 1994). Tall trees are necessary for nesting. It is found up to 700 m, rarely to 900 m in central Europe and to 1,500 m in Russia. It arrives at its breeding grounds from late-April to mid-May and egg-laying occurs May to early June. 

The nest is built by both sexes. It is a well-made structure with a loose foundation of twigs, grass, rootlets, string, etc., often with high proportion of green plants and lined with rootlets, feathers and hair but occasionally it is unlined. Clutch size can be from three to seven eggs but usually five or six. It is a specialized insectivore, although it also feeds on spiders and very rarely vertebrates (Yosef et al. 2008). Prey is taken from the ground and air, although the species requires few perches and often hovers. Unlike other shrikes food hoarding is rare (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is a long distance migrant and spends less than four months on its breeding grounds. European birds depart in the autumn and overwinter in southern Africa before beginning to return in late February or early March (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;Agricultural intensification and an increase in monocultures have driven declines in western and central Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994). Heavy use of fertilizers since the middle of the 20th century has led to an increase in vegetation cover, causing wetter and colder micro-climates close to the soil, this, in turn, has negative effects on the large arthropod fauna on which this species relies (Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2008). The use of insecticides has also contributed to a decline in prey for this species.  Climatic fluctuations, causing wetter conditions in some areas of Europe and drier in others, are also thought to be a serious threat. The species suffers high losses due to predation by natural predators and human disturbance and in central Europe it is persecuted as a predator of song birds (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B437;Lanius_nubicus;This species breeds in areas with a warm Mediterranean climate (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997) and favours natural open woodland with bushes and glades or big isolated trees. It nests in a variety of light deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests or in maquis and maquis-like vegetation. It is monogamous and both sexes build the nest. Egg-laying occurs from April to mid-June. The nest is relatively small, open, very carefully constructed from rootlets, twigs, plant down, plant stems and moss, lined with wool, hair or man-made materials, decorated externally with lichen (more or less camouflaged), in a fork or on a lateral branch of a tree, or sometimes in dense (often thorny) bush. Clutches are typically four to six eggs (Yosef et al. 2008). Grasshoppers and beetles make up the majority of the diet but it also feeds on other insects and small vertebrates such as lizards and small passerines (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997). The species is migratory and most birds winter in sub-Saharan Africa (Yosef et al. 2008).; It is normally  absent from open areas or those near human habitation, but occurs locally in cultivated land dotted with old trees, citrus and olive (Olea) groves, orchards, small fields with tall hedges and many trees, vineyards, gardens, and poplar (Populus) plantations.;In Europe the main likely cause of population decline is degradation of favoured diverse habitats (Yosef et al. 2008), through drainage, afforestation, burning, mature woodland clearance and use of pesticides (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). During migration it suffers from shooting in Turkey and is locally persecuted in Greece as it is considered a bird of ill omen (Yosef et al. 2008).
B438;Lanius_senator;"This species requires shrub-like or arboreal cover, open ground offering rich supply of large insects, and perches with commanding view of area. It is commonly found in semi-open areas with bushes and well-spaced trees, such as open woodland, old orchards, olive (Olea) groves, gardens, and parks or hedgerows with large thorny bushes; in Greece it prefers open pine (Pinus) forest. In many areas it occurs in cultivated country with trees; and in the north of its range it is a typical bird of old traditional orchards, particularly when sheep or cattle present (Yosef et al. 2013). Egg-laying occurs from the end of April through to July, although in Europe second clutches are rare. The nest site is chosen by the male and both sexes build the nest (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997), which is a compact open cup made from twigs and roots and other plant material, lined with rootlets, hair, wool, moss, lichen and spider web. It is generally placed on a lateral branch of a tree, often fruit tree or oak, pine or poplar or in the Mediterranean area, in low dense brush. Clutches are four to eight eggs (Yosef et al. 2013). It feeds principally on insects but other invertebrates, voles, mice, lizards, frogs and occasionally plant material such as berries are also taken (Lefranc and Worfolk 1997). The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, north of the equator (Yosef et al. 2013).";;Loss and degradation of habitat through agricultural intensification, afforestation, and large fires are the main threats to this species (Yosef et al. 2013). The abandonment of traditional charcoal-making, the canalization of rivers and heavy use of herbicides and insecticides are also threats (Tucker and Heath 1994). Long-term climatic changes resulting in wetter springs have caused the range of the species to contract southwards (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is hunted around ponds in summer and on migration in Italy. In addition, drought in the Sahel and changes to agricultural practices in its wintering grounds may lead to long term population declines (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B315;Anthus_berthelotii;"The species is found in the Canary Islands and Madeira where it is sedentary (Tucker and Heath 1994). Birds are found from sea level to over 2,000 m in all habitats except dense woodland and wetter areas. In the eastern Canaries it uses dry, sparsely vegetated semi-desert areas of volcanic rock and other open habitats such as tracks. In the western Canaries it is found in mountainous areas and on rocky hillsides. In Madeira it is most frequently found in the high sierras but can also be found on cliffs and fields near the sea.

It breeds from late January to August probably producing two broods of two to five eggs. The nest of dry grass and roots lined with hair, wool or feathers is built in the shelter of a small bush or stone. It feeds mainly on insects and other invertebrates but also consumes seeds (Tyler 2004).";;There are currently no known threats to this species, however future large-scale developments may impinge on its habitats (Tyler 2004).
B314;Anthus_campestris;"This species is found in open dry habitats, from sand dunes, sandy heaths, dry grassland and clear-felled areas to artificial habitats such as gravel pits, favouring areas with dwarf shrubs and low-growing trees for songposts. The breeding season is from mid-April to mid-August; although it is later in northern Europe, beginning in mid-June in Sweden.

It is monogamous and the nest is a cup of grass stems, leaves and roots, lined with finer plant material and hair and built in a scrape or a hollow on the ground or in a tuft of grass. Usually four to five eggs are laid. The diet is mainly insects, although other invertebrates and seeds are also taken, as well as rarely small vertebrates (Tyler and Christie 2012). The species is essentially migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;In western and central Europe the species is threatened by habitat loss as a result of afforestation of open habitats, scrub encroachment, intensification of agriculture (Tyler and Christie 2012) and eutrophication of cultivated land (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In addition the use of pesticides may also be a threat through the reduction of food availability (Tucker and Heath 1994). Climate change may also have an impact on this species (Tyler and Christie 2004).
B319;Anthus_cervinus;This species breeds in the arctic tundra. It favours willow (Salix) mires with small creeks, sedge (Carex) marshes and peat mounds, both above the treeline and in the mountain birch (Betula) forest (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It arrives at its breeding grounds in late May and egg-laying occurs early to mid-June. The nest is built by the female, although the initial hollow is made by the male and both sexes bring material. It is a cup of grass leaves and stems, some moss and dead leaves at the base, lined with finer grass, hair and feathers and sited on the ground on a hummock or bank. It is also sometimes at end of short tunnel. Clutches can be between two and seven eggs but usually five or six. It forages on the ground and its prey is mainly insects but also other invertebrates, and some vegetable matter (Tyler 2004). The species is migratory and European populations mostly winter in sub-Saharan Africa but scattered wintering sites exist in south-east Italy, Turkey and North Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;The reasons for Finnish decline unknown (Tyler 2004). The species is vulnerable to future climate change (Virkkala et al. 2008).
B317;Anthus_hodgsoni;This species breeds on the edge of taiga, on grassy and bracken-covered slopes, rocky ground and in glades in open forest of oak (Quercus), birch (Betula), alder (Alnus), fir (Abies) or pine (Pinus). It is also found in secondary growth and wooded or abandoned cultivation and scrub with isolated trees, and on barren lava areas and around marshes. Also frequents dwarf juniper (Juniperus) or other scrub above the timber-line. In Europe it breeds from June to August. The nest is a cup of moss and dry grass, lined with finer grass and a few hairs and sited on the ground under a tuft of grass or a rock, or in a shallow depression.  Clutches are usually from three to five eggs (Tyler 2004). It feeds on mostly insects in the summer and seeds in the winter.  The species is a long-distance migrant (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B320;Anthus_petrosus;"This species occupies exposed rocky sea coasts and islands with low vegetation. It occasionally breeds away from coast, such as on St. Kilda (western Scotland), or on islands in large inland lakes, such as in southern Sweden. It can also occur inland along estuaries and at various wetlands or along less rocky coasts, during migration and in winter. Breeding occurs from mid-March to August and varies with latitude. The nest is built by the female in a crevice in a cliff, in a small cavity on a bank or grassy slope, or under a rock or clump of vegetation. It is as a bulky cup of grass stems, leaves and seaweed and rather flimsily lined with finer material. Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds primarily on invertebrates but will also take seeds. The species is resident and migratory: the nominate race is largely resident, with some short-distance dispersal; kleinschmidti may move short distances inland to rivers and lakes or to sandy shores; littoralis is migratory (Tyler 2004).";;There are few threats to this species’s habitat. Locally, oil pollution  on rocky shores can have an adverse, although generally temporary, effect  on this species’s invertebrate prey (Tyler 2004).
B318;Anthus_pratensis;This species breeds in a wide range of open habitats, such as tundra, moorland and heathland, bogs, saltmarshes, dunes, coastal meadows, hillsides, forest clearings, fallow land and occasionally in arable land. In northern Europe peatland is a preferred habitat, while in the British uplands it favours a mosaic of heather (Calluna), bog and grassland. In the winter it is also found along seashores. It breeds from late March to August. The nest is a neat cup of grass, lined with finer grass and hair and is concealed amongst vegetation on the ground. Clutches range from two to seven eggs and clutch size increases with latitude (Tyler 2004). It feeds mainly on invertebrates but does consume some plant seeds in the autumn and winter (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is mainly resident or a partial migrant in western Europe. Birds from Greenland and Iceland migrate to western Europe. Northern and eastern populations are generally medium-distance migrants (Tyler 2004).;;The main cause of declines is thought to be agricultural intensification (Tyler 2004). Populations undergo large annual fluctuations dependent on the severity of the weather on migration and in its wintering areas (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B321;Anthus_spinoletta;The species breeds on alpine pastures and high-lying mountain meadows with short grassland and scattered rocks, bushes or trees, usually with some wet areas and often on mountain slopes. In the winter it is found on coastal saltings, lagoons, marshes, grassy edges of lakes and rivers, sewage farms, watercress farms, rice fields and other irrigated cultivation. In Europe, egg-laying occurs from the end of April to early June. The nest is a cup made of grass stems and leaves with some moss incorporated and lined with finer material and some hairs. It is sited on the ground in the side of a bank or hollow, usually well concealed by vegetation or sometimes at the end of a tunnel. Normally four to six eggs are laid. It feeds mainly on invertebrates but also takes some plant material. The species is chiefly a short-distance or altitudinal migrant (Tyler 2004).;;In some areas, grazing animals have been shown to have a significant negative impact on the nesting success of this species (Pavel 2004). It is also thought to be threatened by climate change (Ebenhoh 2003, Melendez and Laiolo 2014). In addition, the spread of ski pistes has also been shown to be detrimental to this species (Caprio et al. 2014).
B316;Anthus_trivialis;This species breeds in woodland edges, open woodland, cleared woodland and young conifer plantations, often with isolated remaining tall trees. It also uses heathland or grassland with developing scrub and trees. The breeding season occurs from April to August in north-west Europe. The species is mainly monogamous, however polygamy does occasionally occur. The nest is built in a depression in the ground and is a substantial cup of dry grass, often with moss foundation, lined with finer grasses. Normally four to six eggs are laid. The diet includes a variety of invertebrates but is mostly insects. Some plant material is also taken during the winter. The species is a long-distance migrant (Tyler 2004).;;Local declines have been attributed to the changing nature of its habitats, such as in northern and central Europe where aging plantations become increasingly unsuitable for the species but it will quickly recolonize when mature stands are felled (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B310;Motacilla_alba;This species inhabits a very wide variety of non-forested wet and dry habitats, including seashores, rocky or sandy upland rivers and slow-moving lowland rivers, lakeshores, farmland, gardens, parks, short grassland such as that found in vicinity of factories in towns and cities. It is also often found in towns and villages. In southern and south-eastern Europe, it breeds from late April to mid-July. It is monogamous and both sexes build the nest which is a rough cup of twigs, grass stems, leaves, rootlets and mosses, lined with hair, wool or feathers and placed in a hole or crevice in a riverbank, wall or bridge. It also often nests in buildings or even machinery. Clutches are three to eight eggs. It feeds on a wide range of small terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, as well as fish fry, crumbs and other household scraps. In western and southern Europe some populations of the nominate race and of yarrellii are resident but northern populations of the latter are partial migrants (Tyler 2004).;;Climate change is thought to affect the timing of migration for this species (Ahas and Aasa 2006, Sokolov and Gordienko 2008, Kulberg et al. 2015).
B313;Motacilla_cinerea;This species inhabits fast-flowing mountain streams and rivers with riffles and exposed rocks or shoals, often in forested areas. It is also found in more lowland watercourses, even canals, where there are artificial waterfalls, weirs, millraces or lock gates. Outside of the breeding season it occupies a wider variety of habitats, including farmyards, sewage farms, forest tracks and even town centres (Tyler 2004). The breeding season is from the end of March to Early August, however in Europe, most eggs are laid from April to May (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is monogamous and both sexes build the nest which is a typical platform and cup of coarser material, lined with finer grasses, root fibres and often horse hair. It is generally sited on a rock ledge, in a crevice in a riverbank, or often on a ledge in a wall, under a bridge or in a drainpipe. Clutches can be from three to seven eggs. It feeds mainly on insects but also takes freshwater shrimps (Gammarus), terrestrial snails (Mollusca) and spiders (Araneae) (Tyler 2004). The species is mainly a partial migrant in central and Atlantic regions of Europe, a full migrant in northern and eastern Europe and resident or locally dispersive in Britain, Ireland, Belgium, France, Iberia and the Mediterranean (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;The species is vulnerable to severe winters which may produce significant although short term declines (Hagemeijer and Bair 1997, Tyler 2004).
B311;Motacilla_citreola;This species occupies marshes, the edges of lakes, willow (Salix) thickets and wet rough grassland in tundra, also areas of willow bushes on mountain meadows and sometimes in fields near villages. It breeds from April to June with breeding beginning later in the north. The nest is a cup of moss and plant leaves and stems, lined with hair, wool and feathers and sited on the ground in grassy vegetation. Typically it lays three to six eggs. The diet includes a wide variety of invertebrates, often aquatic, and their larvae. The species is migratory, wintering in the Indian subcontinent (Tyler and Kirwan 2015).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B312;Motacilla_flava;This species occupies a range of damp or wet habitats with low vegetation, from damp meadows, marshes, waterside pastures, sewage farms and bogs to damp steppe and grassy tundra. In the north of its range it is also found in large forest clearings. It breeds from April to August, although this varies with latitude. The nest is a grass cup lined with hair and placed on or close to the ground in a shallow scrape. Normally it lays four to six eggs. It feeds on a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates as well as some plant material, particularly seeds. The species is migratory with European populations wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Tyler and Christie 2012).;;Declines in some countries have been linked to agricultural intensification, especially wetland drainage and the replacement of grasslands with cereals. In addition the use of pesticides and the dumping of manure may also be a threat (Tyler and Christie 2012). Populations breeding in southern Europe are likely to be adversely affected by degradation of the Sahel (Wood 1992).
B391;Erithacus_rubecula;"This species is found in forest undergrowth and edge, preferring conifer tracts in some parts of its range and deciduous woodland in others. It uses copses and adjacent open land, farmland woodlots, thickets along watercourses, hedgerows with some tall trees, orchards, gardens and parks and is also found in urban areas in parts of Europe. It requires cool shade, medium-height cover with perches, and patches of bare ground. Breeding occurs from mid-March to August, however timing varies with population across Europe.

The nest is a cup of moss, grass, leaves and twigs and lined with fine grass and hair. It is placed on a bulky mat of leaves and is always sited in a recess, usually in low undergrowth, a hedge, grass bank, wall, rock face, tree cavity, tree roots or nestbox. Typically lays four to seven eggs. The diet is mainly invertebrates, fruits and seeds but it will also take very small vertebrates, carrion, left-overs and bird table foods. Migration in this species is poorly understood but in general it is thought eastern populations are migratory while more western populations are resident or partially migratory (Collar 2005).";;The species is subject to hunting for food around the Mediterranean basin (Collar 2005). Population fluctuations are normally driven by severe, hard winters (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B398;Erythropygia_galactotes;"In Europe the species breeds mainly in artificial habitats such as olive and almond groves, vineyards, young pine (Pinus) plantations, citrus plantations, parks and orchards. On migration and in winter it is found in similar habitats, often around human settlements. The species breeds in Europe from mid-May to June and pairs in Spain are commonly double-brooded.

The nest is a loose flat cup of dry grass stems, rootlets, twigs, bark and leaves, often incorporating shed snakeskin and lined with fine fibres, hair and feathers. It is built in dense vegetation, often spiny, in a reed clump, small tree (commonlyOlea europaea or Pinus halepensis in SE Spain), shrub or grapevine or in a crevice in a building. When nesting on rubbish tips it shows a preference for human artefacts (e.g. oil drum, breeze blocks) over bushes. Clutches are three to six eggs (mean in SE Spain 3.6). It forages mainly on the ground, feeding on insects, spiders centipedes, millipedes and earthworms as well as fruit, berries and seeds (Collar 2005). The subspecies found in Europe are migratory, occupying their breeding grounds between April and September and wintering in central, eastern and sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;The population is modest in Armenia and semi-desert habitats there are under threat of agricultural and urban development (Collar 2005).
B388;Ficedula_albicollis;This species inhabits open forest, forest edges, moist woodland, open country with scattered trees, and well-timbered parks and avenues. It is also found secondarily in gardens and orchards, which it vacates to return to woods immediately after breeding. It requires old trees offering nest-holes high enough above ground and prefers deciduous woodland. Egg-laying occurs from mid-April to early July in central Europe and from late April in Ukraine. The nest is a cup of dry grass, leaves and stalks, lined with fine grass and placed 3-32 m (usually 10-15 m) above ground in a hole in a tree, wall or building. Clutches can be from one to nine eggs but typically five to seven. The diet is mostly flying insects and other arthropods but it also takes some seeds and fruits of currant (Ribes), rowan (Sorbus) and elder (Sambucus). The species is migratory but migration routes and wintering areas are poorly known (Taylor 2006).;;This species is known to hybridize with Ficedula hypoleuca (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B387;Ficedula_hypoleuca;This species breeds in most well-wooded and forest habitats, so long as suitable cavities for nest-sites are present. It prefers deciduous forests (which contain more natural cavities) over coniferous forest. In Europe, its typical habitat is deciduous and mixed, sunny, open mature woodland, supplemented by orchards, avenues, parks, and even gardens in low-density human settlements. Breeding occurs from late April to the end of June. The nest is a loose cup of dead leaves, plant stems and moss, which is lined with rootlets, fine grasses, hair and (sometimes) feathers. It is sited 1.8-10 m above the ground in a hole in a tree, wall or building. In western Europe it mainly uses nestboxes. Clutches can be from three to ten eggs but usually four to eight. The diet is mostly insects, both flying and non-flying, but it will take other invertebrates and some fruit and seeds. The species is migratory, wintering in west Africa (Taylor and Christie 2013).;;The species is threatened earlier peaks of invertebrate populations resulting in a mismatch with breeding as a result of climate change (Both et al. 2006).
B390;Ficedula_parva;"This species breeds in forest and woodland, mainly mixed deciduous stands, especially with beech (Fagus), but also in oak (Quercus) forest; also in spruce (Picea) forest in the north of its range. It favours tall trees with much undergrowth, light canopy, and an open zone with perching twigs between canopy and undergrowth layer as well as glades, clearings and areas near water. It also occurs in orchards and vineyards. In central and eastern Europe it nests from mid-May to the end of June. The nest is a cup of moss, dry grass stalks and leaves, root fibres and hair, lined with hair and sometimes with lichen woven into the outside. It is normally placed in a hole in a tree or wall, among the side shoots of a trunk, sometimes on a branch close to the trunk, or even in a fork in the branches. Nestboxes are also accepted. Clutches are typically five or six eggs. It feeds mainly on insects and other invertebrates (Taylor 2006).";;As the species relies on old, diversified forests it is vulnerable to modern forestry practices in Europe, such as shorter rotations and the felling of old trees. As a result it may face a shortage of nesting sites in the future (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B389;Ficedula_semitorquata;"Within its breeding range it favours forest belts mainly on mountain slopes up to about 2,000 m, occupied by mature deciduous trees (notably oak Quercus and hornbeam Carpinus) as well as temperate riverine and swamp forests of Fraxinus oxycarpa; and in plane (Platanus orientalis) galleries (Handrinos, 1997). Occasionally the species breeds in old or abandoned orchards, groves and tree plantations, urban parks and large gardens or forested peripheral parts of towns, villages and industrial sites (Iankov, 2007). Breeding takes place from mid-April to mid-July. The female builds the nest; a cup of dead leaves, dead plant stems, lichens and moss, lined with fine rootlets, grasses or bark fibre, sometimes hair, feathers or plant down, placed in a hole in a tree, commonly an old woodpecker hole. Clutches are normally five to six eggs. The diet consists mainly of flying insects as well as spiders and snails (Taylor and Christie 2013). This species is migratory, although its movements are poorly understood. It moves south in the autumn to its main wintering area in south and central Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997)";;The species suffers from habitat destruction in some areas, which is likely to be responsible for recent declines. Lowland oak (Quercus spp.) forests in Bulgaria (its favoured habitat in this country) have been overexploited for timber, and riparian forests have been cleared for riverbed corrections. In eastern Turkey, its riparian forest habitat is threatened by ongoing dam projects and the rapid loss of other Quercus forests may also be having a negative impact (S. Isfendiyaroglu in litt. 2005).
B397;Irania_gutturalis;During the breeding season this species occupies semi-desert, mountain steppe, stony arid hillsides with scrub patches, scrubby valleys, ravines with mountain streams, narrow stony gullies, subalpine vegetation including juniper (Juniperus), Zygophyllum, bushes and tall weed. It is usually found at 1,000–2,200 m. In the Caucasus, breeding occurs from May to June. The nest is a flat cup of twigs and cereal stalks, lined with feathers and/or hair and set low down (average 0.5 m up) in a tree cavity, bush or on a stump or log. Clutches are four to six eggs (Collar 2005). The diet is mainly insects in the breeding season and fruit is also taken in the autumn. The species is migratory, wintering in a rather restricted area of east Africa (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B394;Luscinia_calliope;During the breeding season this species is found in lowland taiga and subalpine shrubbery, clearings in forests by meadows and rivers, windfall gaps, regenerating burns with tall grass and bushes, birch coppices, clumps and stands of willow and aspen in bogs, patches of montane dwarf pine, krummholz above tree-line, overgrown forest edges and tangled thickets near mountain streams. It favours areas with fallen trees, dense bushes and stands of bird cherry (Prunus padus) and dog rose (Rosa canina), usually near fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea) stands and riverine meadows. In Russia it breeds from May to July and possibly August. The nest is a loose cup or dome made of fine grasses and roots, usually lightly lined with hair and plant down, placed on the ground in the shelter of a bush or dense tuft of herbage. Clutches are four to six eggs. It is insectivorous, taking flies and their larvae, ants, wasps and beetles and also some plant material. The species is migratory, wintering in south-east Asia (Collar 2005).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B392;Luscinia_luscinia;This species occupies lowland river valleys with deciduous and mixed woodland bordering waterbodies, beech (Fagus) and hornbeam (Carpinus) forest, small woodlots of young deciduous trees, dense thickets in forest edges, regenerating forest on clear-cut land, wet willow (Salix) thickets, alder (Alnus) carrs, lowland orchards, river gorges, urban scrub, parks and cemeteries. It requires deep soft humus with some leaf litter, tall, dense, patchy herbage, and thickets of brambles, bushes, shrubs and low trees typically along riverbanks, near standing water or in damp depressions. Breeding occurs from mid-May to early July. The nest is a loose bulky cup of leaves and grass, lined with fine stems and hair, placed on ground in sheltered position among dead branches, roots or thick leaf litter. Clutches are four or five eggs. The diet is mainly invertebrates with some fruit. The species is migratory, wintering in Africa (Collar 2005).;;Fluctuations within populations of the species’s appear to correlate with changes in habitat composition and climate amelioration. During the 1900s, numbers fell with the decline of slash-and-burn cultivation which produced its preferred young deciduous woodlands (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B393;Luscinia_megarhynchos;"This species occupies two main habitat types in Europe: lowland open woodland with thickets and dense patches of vegetation of coppice stands, nettles and brambles, bordering waterbodies; and the edges and glades of broadleaf woodland, undergrowth-rich pinewoods and dry maquis, garrigue and shrubbery on sand and chalk (i.e. with no surface water). It is also found in various mixtures of the two, such as cultivated land with mature hedgerows and untended bush-rich suburban gardens and parks with leaf litter. It breeds from late April to mid July. The nest is an occasionally domed bulky cup of dead leaves and grass, lined with fine grasses, feathers and hair. It is sited on or very close to the ground (most are below 0.5 m) in the base of a thicket or in low herbage. Clutches are four to five eggs. It feeds principally on invertebrates but takes berries and seeds in the late summer and autumn (Collar and Christie 2013). The species is migratory, wintering in the Afrotropics (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;Declines in the west of its range have been driven since the 1950s by modern agricultural development and an increasing tendency for 'tidying' of gardens and woodland. Nesting habitat along streams and rivers is being lost in Spain (Collar and Christie 2013). The species is also sensitive to climatic variations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In the U.K., it is thought that habitat modification as a result of grazing by deer may be a threat to this species (Newson et al. 2011).
B395;Luscinia_svecica;For breeding, this species appears to require copious low dense vegetation with patches of open ground. It breeds in ecotone habitats between forest and plain or open areas at tree-line, including wooded tundra, mountain steppe, subalpine scrub, marshland with low woody cover, clumps of willow (Salix), alder (Alnus) and birch (Betula) on floodplains, riverbank thickets, reedy and shrub-dominated lakeshores, bushy sites near water. The breeding season is from late April to July in central Europe, from late May in Scandinavia and early April to June in Armenia. The nest is a deep cup of leaves, small twigs, dry grass, rootlets, plant down and moss, which is occasionally lined with animal hair. It is placed among grass and scrub on wet ground and is commonly associated with topographic features such as a hummock, gulley, lip of a bank, or tussock. Clutches are four to seven eggs. The diet is principally invertebrates, particularly insects but it does take some seeds and fruit in the autumn (Collar 2005). The species is mainly migratory, with west Palearctic populations wintering in patches across the Mediterranean Basin and the northern Afrotropics and eastern populations in the Indian subcontinent (Snow and Perris 1998).;;In Europe, this species experiences pronounced but largely unexplained population fluctuations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar 2005). Some negative trends appear to be explained by natural succession in marshland, drainage and management practices such as reed-cutting, seedling removal and cattle grazing (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), but recovery has taken place without the reversal of these circumstances. In Spain, during the 1990s it may have suffered from degradation of habitat through grazing and in Austria, significant losses have occurred during the 19th century due to drainage and it now faces threats there due to stabilization of lake levels, successional loss of reed-belt, and occupation of secondary habitats on arable land (where nest predation elevated) (Collar 2005).
B333;Monticola_saxatilis;The species breeds on wild rocky mountain slopes and stony hills up to 3,800 m near patches of herbs or small shrubs which are used as foraging sites (Tucker and Heath 1994). In Europe it breeds from May to June. It is territorial and the male performs display-flights over its territory. The nest is a neat flat cup of coarse grass, rootlets and moss, lined with moss and fine rootlets. Normally it is placed under a rock overhang or in a horizontal rock crevice, wall or ruin, sometimes under a boulder on steep hillside and occasionally in a tree hole. Nest sites are often used successively, including from year to year. Clutches are typically four to six eggs. It feeds principally on insects but also fruit and berries (Collar and Bonan 2013). Typically it forages by surveying from a perch then flying to the ground to take prey (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is a nocturnal trans-Saharan migrant (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). European birds begin to leave their breeding grounds from August to September. Aside from a small number wintering in the southern Arabian Peninsula, the entire species overwinters in Africa (Collar and Bonan 2013).;;Declines in Europe may be owing to habitat loss in both summer and winter quarters through afforestation and tourism development, as well as succession following pastoral abandonment in Europe. The proportion of upland pasture (i.e. overgrazed, barren hill country) in Franconia fell from 20% in 1850 to 1% in 1995 (Collar and Bonan 2013).
B334;Monticola_solitarius;During the breeding season this species is found on precipitous cliffs, in steep rocky valleys and defiles, ravines and gorges, on crags, outcrops, arid boulder-strewn slopes, sea cliffs and headlands, rocky coasts, ruins, quarries and open mines, isolated stone buildings, churches in rural valleys. In areas of southern Europe where Turdus merula is absent it frequents the roofs of houses, churches, castles and monuments . The key habitat features for this species appear to be vertical faces (cliffs, buildings) and diverse vegetation over 20-80% of area. In Iberia breeding occurs from the end April to mid-July. The nest is a shallow cup or rough pad of coarse dry grass, rootlets, moss and leaves, loosely constructed and lined with fine soft grass, rootlets and occasional feathers and plant down. It is generally sited under a rock overhang, in a crevice of cliff, rock, bank, cave or building and sometimes in a tree hole, generally two to five metres above ground. Clutches are three to six eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and fruit. In Europe the species is sedentary and a partial migrant (Collar 2005).;and will occasionally invades urban environments.  In Europe, during the winter it may occupy habitats rarely used for breeding, such as olive orchards.;From 1970 to 1990 the species suffered declines in Spain and Italy as a result of new coastal tourist developments, flooding of canyons and gorges for reservoirs, renovation of old towers and churches, and afforestation and regrowth of matorral following pastoral abandonment. However in Spain these pressures do not explain declines in all areas (Collar 2005). In Malta the species has been driven to occupy inaccessible coastal areas by persecution, such as nest robbing and catching of birds, and human disturbance (Tucker and Heath 1994, Collar 2005).
B386;Muscicapa_striata;This species inhabits almost any open woodland or timbered area with raised perches providing an open view. During the breeding season it favours well-spaced mature trees to younger trees and bushes, and thus has adapted well to avenues, parks, gardens, orchards and other man-made habitats, as well as occupying many types of deciduous or coniferous woodland. It is also found at woodland edges, in forest glades, clearings and burnt patches, and in trees along streams, rivers and edges of standing water. The breeding season in Europe is from mid-May to mid-August. The nest is a bulky cup of loosely piled fine twigs, rootlets, dead leaves, pieces of decaying bark, moss, dry grass, lichens and fibres, bound with hair and lined with hair, feathers and finer material. It is sited above the ground on a natural or artificial ledge, in a niche, at the base of a basket-shaped tuft of twigs against a tree trunk, in a hole in a tree, branch or stump, in creeper against a tree or wall, or on top of a flat branch. Clutches are two to seven eggs, but most commonly four to six. It is insectivorous, feeding mainly on flying insects, especially flies (Diptera) and hymenopterans but will also take other invertebrates and some fruits. The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Taylor 2006).;;In north-west Europe, it is thought that declines may be due to a long sequence of  generally cooler summers, or adverse factors such as biocide-induced reductions or contamination of insect populations, removal of old trees and general habitat deterioration (Taylor 2006).
B408;Oenanthe_chrysopygia;During the breeding season this species inhabits gently angled to steep arid rocky and stony slopes and screes with scattered boulders, stony mountain ridges and ravines, and dry fallow fields in remote valleys and sometimes on level boulder fields. It is commonly found near small or large perennial streams and favours sparse dwarf montane shrubs. It breeds from April to June in the Caucasus (Collar 2005). The nest is a loosely constructed, shallow cup of dry grass and coarser plant fibres, lined with finer fibres stripped from plant stems and sometimes placed on a thick base of debris. It is set in a hole in rocks, among stones, or in the wall of a build and occasionally in the burrow of a Bee-eater (Snow and Perrins 1998). The diet is mainly invertebrates, principally ants and beetles but also takes some plant matter (Collar 2005). The species is migratory, wintering in eastern Africa and south-west Asia (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"The size of the European population renders it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population."
B410;Oenanthe_cypriaca;This species inhabits a wide range of habitats, including mountain pine forest clearings, hills and mountains with rough open ground and scattered trees, broken rocky ground, open natural and farmed lowlands, woodland and plantations, gardens, industrial and suburban areas and house compounds. The breeding season is from April to July. The nest is a loose bulky cup of grass and roots, placed low down in a hole in an earth bank, stone or mud wall, terrace, roadside, tree, behind loose eucalypt bark or under a stone. It can also be set in a cave or an artificial site, such as a metal pipe, empty can, flowerpot, shed shelves or nestbox. Clutches are four to five eggs (Collar 2005). The diet is almost entirely insects, especially ants beetles and grasshoppers but will also take berries and has been recorded taking a lizard. The species is migratory, wintering mostly in Sudan and Ethiopia (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The only known threat to this species in Cyprus is from bird-catchers using lime-sticks and mist-nets and also from shooting at migration times (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B409;Oenanthe_deserti;This species occupies dry steppes, dry sparsely bushed riverbeds, wadis, ruins and stony and gravel flatlands. The time of breeding is not recorded but in Israel this species breeds from early April to mid-July. The nest is a rather bulky construction, made of grass and root fibres and lined with finer grass, wool, hair or feathers. It is set in a hole in a roadside or riverbank, rock face, wall, bridge or other building, under a stone, bush or pile of stones, amid exposed roots or down old rodent burrow. Clutches are three to six eggs. The diet is principally invertebrates but will also occasionally take seeds (Collar 2005). The species is migratory, although some populations are only partially migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B405;Oenanthe_finschii;This species breeds in rocky sloping country, and particularly limestone canyons and ravines, in and at bases of foothills and low mountains in sparsely vegetated scrubby semi-desert, dry boulder-strewn slopes with outcrops and clefts, screes, talus mounds, empty gulleys and ravines and adjacent dry fields. In the winter it favours more open plains areas. Breeding occurs from April in the west of its range until to July in Armenia and from May to June in the Caucasus. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and plant stems, lined with grass and hair and set in a shallow ground depression among rocks or under a heap of stones. Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, especially ants and beetles, but also takes seeds and other vegetable material. The species is a migrant or partial migrant and, in the south of its breeding range, it is probably sedentary or makes short-distance vertical movements (Collar 2005).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B407;Oenanthe_hispanica;This species breeds in warm climatic zones in stony, scrubby, often broken terrain (slopes and foothills) around open woodland of alerce (Tetraclinis), juniper (Juniperus) or oak (Quercus), amid Olea and Pistacia scrub, olive trees, cactus groves, and in fallowland, vineyards, dry maquis steppe and shrub-covered limestone hills. Breeding begins from late April in Spain and from early May in Greece and Armenia. The nest is a rather flat cup of stems, moss and fibres, lined with hair or down and set on the ground under a stone, rocky overhang or tussock, among scree, in burrow or hole in ruin or wadi bank. Clutches are typically four of five eggs. The diet is made up of invertebrates, berries and seeds. The species is migratory and travels on a broad front across the Mediterranean and Sahara to winter in the African Sahel (Collar 2005).;;Since 1970 the species has declined in western Europe, most likely due to drought in its wintering quarters and agricultural intensification, as well as afforestation (Collar 2005). It may also be threatened locally by predation from foxes (Vulpes) and feral dogs (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B411;Oenanthe_isabellina;This species is found in arid, open, sparsely vegetated country, including dry plains, mountain and lowland steppes, semi-desert, wadis and desert margins, commonly where burrowing rodents, such as gerbil (Rhombomys opimus), occur. In Armenia, it is found in rolling semi-desert with Tamarix, Artemisia, Euphorbia, Alhagi, Atraphaxis and Gypsophila, and in usually on south-facing mountain steppe with Astragalus. Breeding occurs from March to June in Armenia and from March to July in southern Russia. The nest is a shallow, bulky cup of dried grass, roots and hair, lined with hair, wool and feathers. It is set deep in a rodent burrow or burrow of a similar mammal and less often in and old bee-eater (Meropidae) hole or occasionally in a natural hole or crevice. Clutches are four to seven eggs. The diet is mainly invertebrates, particularly insects such as beetles and ants and vegetable matter. The species is migratory (Collar 2005).;;The species is linked to some extent to populations of burrow-nesting rodents, which supply nest-holes. As a result, declines in these species, such as falls in gerbil numbers due to ploughing, may impact this species (Collar 2005).
B403;Oenanthe_leucura;This species inhabits steep rocky arid landscapes with rock walls, scattered boulders, bare ground and sparse scrub. It inhabits gorges, ravines, steep-sided wadis, hillsides, screes, scarps, outcrops, sea cliffs, ancient hilltop settlements, ruins and old deserted houses, in wooded, semi-wooded, semi-desert and bare areas. In southern Spain, nest-building begins mid-February and in the Pyrenees from mid-April. The nest is a bulky cup of grass and rootlets, lined with hair and feathers and sited under a rock or tussock, or up in hole in rock, wadi bank or wall. Clutches are three to five eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, small lizards and plant matter. The species is largely or strictly sedentary, but movements are variable and may be complex (Collar 2005).;, avoiding flat terrain;Declines in Iberia have been attributed to severe winters and afforestation as well as the disappearance of derelict buildings and man-made caves (Collar 2005). Nests in man-made structures are safer from predators, which may also be a threat (Tucker and Heath 1994)
B404;Oenanthe_oenanthe;During the breeding season this species occupies open ground including open stony estuarine plains with sparse clumps of vegetation, sand dunes, shingle stretches, clifftops, coastal islands, heavily grazed heathland and downland, moors, meadows, walled fields, stone-studded bogs, open submontane shrubland, rocky alpine meadows, streamside bluffs, lowland and montane tundra above tree-line. Breeding occurs from early May to June in central and southern Europe, early/mid-April to the end of July or early August in north-west Europe, late May and June in Iceland, and early or mid-May to early July in Scandinavia. The nest is an unlined cup of leaves, stems, moss, lichen, feathers and hair bedded on a cradle and foundation of dried stems and grasses and set in a well-sheltered rock cavity, narrow crevice, rodent burrow, hole in a wall or under stones. Clutches are four to eight eggs. It feeds on arthropods, particularly insects. The species is a long-distance migrant (Collar and de Juana 2013).;;In many western and central European countries it has declined due to habitat change through agricultural intensification and urbanization. In some countries a reduction in sheep-farming has reduced the amount of short-grass habitat much favoured by species. In the past droughts in the Sahel wintering quarters may also have caused declines. In Europe, it used to be trapped for food and is still taken in large numbers in parts of Mediterranean Basin and northern Africa (Collar 2005).
B406;Oenanthe_pleschanka;This species typically occupies arid rocky desolate semi-desert, stony slopes, rocky outcrops, lightly wooded slopes, hilly pastures and fallow fields in flat and undulating steppe country as well as riverbanks, gulleys, crags and cliffs. Breeding is from early May in the Ukraine. The nest is a loose flat cup of coarse plant stems and rootlets, lined with fine stems, animal hair and wool and typically with a base and/or entrance platform of small twigs. It is set in a small cavity under a stone, or in the wall of a gulley, bank or building. Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, especially ants and beetles but supplements with fruit in the autumn (Collar 2005). The species is migratory, wintering in eastern Africa and south-west Arabia (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In Bulgaria, the species is known to hybridize with Oenanthe oenanthe where their ranges overlap, but this is not thought to be a serious threat (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B399;Phoenicurus_ochruros;"This species is found in sparsely vegetated rocky areas, including stony slopes with xerophytic vegetation, crags and gullies in high river valleys and rocky mountain tops up to snow-line as well as villages, towns and cities. In Carpathians, it is mainly found on mountain slopes covered with juniper (Juniperus), scree and boulders. The breeding season runs from mid-April to mid-July in western Europe but can be up to two weeks later in eastern Europe.

The nest is a loose cup of grass, moss, hair, wool and feathers, which is set in a crevice of a wall or rock, or in an earth bank, pile of stones or on the ground. Clutches are four to six eggs. The diet consists of invertebrates and berries. The species is resident, partially migrant, a vertical migrant and fully migrant (Collar 2005) in different parts of its range and the main wintering area for west Palearctic breeders is the Mediterranean basin (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;It is thought large scale redevelopment and regeneration of city centre sites is causing the loss of suitable breeding habitat for the species. In addition nest sites are vulnerable to accidental removal or disturbance as they also nest in railway-sidings, lorry parks and similar locations (Wildlife Trust 2013).
B400;Phoenicurus_phoenicurus;This species inhabits open forest and woodland, including old parkland and park-like gardens, forest clearings and margins, preferably with semi-open undergrowth or herbage. In northern Europe, it occupies subarctic mountain birch and barren pine forests and in central and southern Europe it uses broadleaf forest, as well as many intermediate habitats such as heaths and commons with scattered mature trees, pollard willows (Salix) along streams and ditches, open hilly country with old stone walls and buildings. In Russia, it generally prefers broadleaf and mixed forest, less often pinewoods. The breeding season is from the end of April to mid-July but up to two weeks earlier in southern Europe. The nest is a cup of grass, roots and moss, lined with hair and feathers and usually set one to six metres up in a hole in a tree, wall or old stump, or in a nestbox, commonly with one side with open terrain. Clutches are five to seven eggs. The diet is made up of fruits and berries. The species is migratory (Collar and Christie 2013).;;Severe declines in central Europe have been attributed to rainfall patterns in the Sahel combined with intensified modern forestry practices (reducing availability of nest holes) and interspecific nest-site competition. However the evidence for these is not strong and a partial recovery in Britain can not be explained by changes in these factors (Collar and Christie 2013). The species may be subject to habitat degradation from pollution effects on forests in this region (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). There is also evidence that in north-west Europe the species is subject to deliberate killing (Collar and Christie 2013).
B513;Saxicola_dacotiae;"This species is found on rocky hillsides and ""barranco"" (= ravine) habitats with shrubby vegetation cover (Illera 2001), typically of aulaga (Launaea arborescens), saltwort (Salsola vermiculata) and box-thorn (Lycium intricatum). These habitats support a high abundance of invertebrates, and provide suitable nesting sites and perches from which the species can forage for arthropods (Illera 2001). It also occurs on the edge of vegetated ""malpaíses"" (= lava flows), dry and flowing watercourses, cultivated areas and gardens (Martín and Lorenzo 2001). Individuals appear to show strong site fidelity, potentially as a consequence of low spatial variance in the habitat characteristics determining reproductive success (Illera and Díaz 2008).

The breeding season is typically from mid- February to late March but is linked to the timing and extent of winter rains so can be as early as January. The nest is a firm cup of plant stems and roots, incorporating much Salsola and lined with goat hair. Generally placed on the (usually sloping) ground among stones and rocks, in cactus thickets, under shrubs (L. intricatum) or bushy grass clumps, or low down (below 0·5 m) in a wall or side of barranco and often sheltered by an overhanging stone or bush. Clutch size can be two to five but usually four eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, including caterpillars, ants, ichneumon flies, flies, centipedes, beetles and spiders. The species is sedentary although there have been reports of birds possibly dispersing to other islands in the past (Collar 2005).";;"Recent rapid increases in infrastructural development, such as tourist and residential centres, road building, industrial plants, mineral operations and golf courses are destroying the habitat of this species (particularly on the Jandía peninsula in the south of Fuerteventura) (Illera 2004). Additional threats include excessive and increasing livestock grazing (A. Iñigo in litt. 2011), including cattle and extensively-ranched, semi-feral ""coastal"" goats (which accelerates desertification and reduces vegetation cover and food availability (Illera and Díaz 2006)), and nest predation by feral cats (Felis catus) (Medina and Nogales 2009) and other introduced mammals such as rats Rattus spp. (Illera 2004, Illera and Díaz 2006). High fidelity to particular sites may exacerbate the problem of the destruction and degradation of optimal habitats (Illera and Díaz 2008)."
B401;Saxicola_rubetra;This species breeds in wet meadows, pastures, bogs, upland grassland, bracken-covered hillsides, heath, dry or wet open scrub and the fringes of reedbeds. It generally requires scattered shrubs, bushes, trees or man-made perches for songposts and foraging vantages, and low herb cover and bare ground in which to forage (shrubs and herb layer also needed for nesting). In north-west Europe, breeding occurs from mid-April to early August. The nest is a cup of grass stems, leaves and moss, lined with fine stems and hair and placed in a low bush or tussock. Clutches are four to seven eggs. The diet is mainly invertebrates, with fruits and seeds also taken in the autumn. The species is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa (Collar 2005).;;The species has declined due to the intensification of agriculture and the advancing of harvesting dates (Collar 2005).
B402;Saxicola_torquatus;"This species is found in a variety of essentially open, usually rather barren landscapes. In Europe, it occupies open scrubby country where bushes and shrubs of different height, and/or low man-made structures such as stone walls, fence lines, telephone wires and field posts, sit within or adjacent to flat or rolling terrain with uneven herb-rich substrate. It also inhabits alpine moorland, heathland, grassy hillsides, dry plains, bush-studded pastures, woodland edge, sandy forest clearings, field margins and fallows, wide shrubby riverbeds, open garrigue with Cistus, unkempt marshy areas, swamp fringes, roadsides and railway margins and vineyards.

The breeding season is from March to mid-August in north-west Europe and from the end of April to late July in east Europe. The nest is a loose deep cup of rootlets, grass, leaves and plant stems, lined with finer rootlets and sometimes hair, wool and feathers. It is set on the ground or in a low bank, well hidden at base of tuft of herbage or in the bottom of or under a small bush. Clutches are usually four to six eggs. The diet is primarily invertebrates, mainly small or medium-sized insects and their larvae but it occasionally takes small vertebrates, seeds and fruit (Collar 2005). The species varies from migratory to resident in different parts of its range, being sensitive to cold weather (Snow and Perrins 1998).";;Declines in Europe since the 1950s have been driven by a loss of breeding habitats due to agricultural intensification (Collar 2005), including the creation of large open fields, destruction of bushes and hedges, transformation of pastures to arable fields, the afforestation of fallow and moorland and the destruction of structurally diverse vegetation by uncontrolled fire and human disturbance (Tucker and Heath 1994). It has also suffered from the withdrawal of grazing from littoral heaths (Collar 2005). Severe winters have also caused populations to fluctuate (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B396;Tarsiger_cyanurus;This species breeds in Siberian taiga forest, with a preference for old-growth mossy moist spruce (Picea) tracts with fallen trees and sparse undergrowth, often on hilly slopes, but also pine (Pinus) and mixed forests with birch (Betula) and rhododendron. In Russia, breeding occurs from May to August and it lays three to seven eggs. The nest is a cup of grass, moss, ferns, twigs and roots, which is lined with hair, feathers, fine grass and sometimes pine needles. It is set in the hollow of a tree, among tree roots, under a rotten log or in a hole in a bank or steep slope. The diet is not well studied but is thought to be mostly invertebrates, especially insects as well as fruits and seeds when it is not breeding. In Europe the species is a long-distance migrant (Collar and de Juana 2013).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B432;Oriolus_oriolus;In western Europe the species is usually found in semi-open, mixed broadleaf woodlands and plantations, riverine forests with tall willows (Salix) and poplars (Populus), forested steppes, groves, copses, orchards, parks, large gardens, windbreaks, avenue trees, and other tree clumps in cultivated areas. It also occurs in larger and more continuous deciduous, coniferous or mixed forests in eastern Europe. Eggs are laid mainly in May and June and the nest is built by the female only, although the male may collect some material. The nest is a shallow to deep open-cup structure woven from grass, sedges, reeds, leaves, twigs, cloth, string, paper and plastic strips, strips of bark and other plant fibres and then lined with fine fibres, roots and grasses, feathers, cocoons, cobweb, down, cotton, fur, wool, moss, lichens, straw and small pieces of paper. It is suspended hammock-like in thin, horizontal forked branch, typically high in outer edge of well-foliaged tree canopy. Clutches are usually three to five eggs. Its diet is mainly small invertebrates and fruits but it occasionally consumes seeds, nectar, pollen and rarely, small lizards, small mammals, eggs and nestlings (Walther and Jones 2008). The species is migratory, wintering in the climatically temperate, equatorial African high woodlands and moist montane forests of East Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Brood size can be severely affected by the weather conditions which may cause large, short-term fluctuations in the population at regional or supra-regional level. The species is persecuted in Greece (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), as they consume large quantities of fruit and are thus considered a pest by some fruit-farmers (Walther and Jones 2008). In the UK, the loss of large poplar plantations has led to the decline of the species there (Holling et al. 2007). In addition, climate change may pose a threat in the future (Mason and Allsop 2009).
B418;Periparus_ater;This species occupies conifer forests of various compositions and structure (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In Europe it is often found in conifer plantations and in urban and suburban areas with small numbers of conifers. Outside of the breeding season it uses similar habitats, but is also more frequently found in deciduous woodland, parks and gardens. The breeding season is from the end of March to late July and it breeds later in the north of its range than in the south. The nest is cup-shaped and made almost entirely of moss, some animal hair and wool with some feathers incorporated. It is placed in a hole or cavity in a tree trunk or old stump, but sometimes it also uses a hole or crevice in a wall or rocks, in the ground under stones or a nestbox. Clutches are five to thirteen eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, seeds and sap and will visit bird tables and feeders. It has also learnt to pierce or open milk-bottle tops to take cream. The species is resident (Gosler and Clement 2007).;;Declines in central Europe are due to large-scale reductions in arthropods caused by industrial pollution and acid rain (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Gosler and Clement 2007).
B421;Cyanistes_caeruleus;This species inhabits broad-leaved woodland, as well as coppices, parks and gardens. In the Canary Islands it also frequents montane conifer woodland. Provided suitable nest-holes are present this species will even occur in inner cities. Egg-laying begins late April to early May (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is built by the female and is mostly a cup of moss, dried grass, fine bark strips, plant fibres, leaves, animal hair and feathers, placed in a hole or a cleft in a tree or post or other artificial site. Nestboxes are widely used. In Europe clutches are generally seven to thirteen eggs (Gosler et al. 2013). It feeds primarily on insects and spiders, as well as fruits, seeds, nectar and pollen. The diet varies with seasonal and other changes in food abundance. The species is essentially resident though in the centre and north of its range it makes irregular eruptive movements (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;The species is subject to high annual and local fluctuations driven by habitat carrying capacity, breeding success, winter mortality (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and competition from Parus major (Gosler et al. 2013).
B417;Poecile_cinctus;"This species is restricted to northern boreal areas where it occurs as far north as the northern forest limit (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is found in areas of lowland conifer forest, which is mostly of old-growth spruce (Picea) but also larch (Larix) and pine (Pinus), especially in areas with dead or decaying trees. The species breeds from May to July and is monogamous. The nest is a platform of decaying wood, moss, grass stems and animal hair or fur, in a hole in a rotting tree trunk or stump; however it will use nestboxes as well. Clutches can be from four to eleven eggs. The diet is made up mainly of small invertebrates, but it will also consume seeds and scraps from bird tables or refuse scraps. The species is sedentary, remaining within territories all year; juveniles are more nomadic (Gosler and Clement 2007).";;The species declined in Finland and probably Sweden too due to large-scale clearfelling during World War II and has suffered from fragmentation its habitat. Modern forestry practices remove dead and dying trees and the species suffers poor nesting success in heavily managed forests (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Climatic changes may also negatively affect its habitat. In severe winters it is often entirely reliant on food provided at human settlements (Gosler and Clement 2007).
B419;Lophophanes_cristatus;This species breeds predominately in coniferous woods. In Fennoscandia and western and central Europe it is found in forests of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) or Norway Spruce (Picea abies). In southern Europe it uses mixed-conifer montane forests (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It breeds from March to June and is monogamous, forming a lifelong pair bond. The nest is a cup of moss, lichens, animal hair, wool, feathers and gossamer, in a hole in a dead or decaying tree trunk, branch or stump, occasionally in a living tree. Occasionally uses a hole in a fence post or in the ground and nestboxes are also regularly used. It usually lays five to eleven eggs. It feeds mainly on small invertebrates and their larvae and outside the breeding season it will also consume seeds and some fruits. The species is mostly resident but is nomadic in the winter (Gosler and Clement 2007).;;Populations of this species fluctuate in response to severe winter weather. The modernization of forestry practices has resulted in declines in Sweden and Czech Republic. In Scotland it suffered during 18th century from the destruction of its native Caledonian pine forest (Gosler and Clement 2007). In central Europe, atmospheric pollution has also lead to declines in this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B422;Cyanistes_cyanus;This species inhabits a wide variety of lowland forested habitats, including light deciduous and mixed woodlands with shrubby underlayer, also riverine thickets of willow (Salix), birch (Betula) or poplar (Populus). It is also found in trees along ditches at edges of cultivation, orchards, marshland edges and bushy or shrubby areas. In more upland areas it breeds in birch forest with willow and larch (Larix) thickets and stands of spruce (Picea) or juniper (Juniperus) (Gosler et al. 2007). In European Russia, eggs are laid from mid-May (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is monogamous and the female builds the nest, which is mostly a cup of dry grasses, moss, plant down, animal fur and wool, in a hole or cavity in a tree, sometimes among rocks or in a hole in building, occasionally in a pole. Clutches are usually seven to eleven eggs (Gosler et al. 2007). It mainly feeds on invertebrates, including adults, pupae, larvae and eggs, as well as spiders, seeds and fruit. The species is resident over much of its range (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
"
B414;Poecile_lugubris;This species inhabits dry maquis areas of scattered trees and bushes, including olive (Olea) groves, wild plum (Prunus) orchards and other fruit trees and vineyards. It also uses parkland areas of open oak (Quercus) forests including scrub oak, beech (Fagus), willows (Salix) and poplars (Populus) and conifers, particularly spruce (Picea) and cedars (Cedrus), especially in areas of rocky limestone hills. It breeds from March to early August and is monogamous. The nest is a cup of wool, plant material, bark strips, animal hair and feathers, placed in a hole in a tree, often in rotting wood in a fruit tree but also among rocks on banks and will use nestboxes. Normally lays five to seven eggs. The diet is principally insects although it does consume seeds as well.  The species is resident (Gosler and Clement 2007).;;"In Armenia, the species is threatened by an increasing number of wild fires and the use of toxic agricultural chemicals (Aghasyan and Kalashyan 2010).
"
B420;Parus_major;This species occupies mostly open deciduous and mixed forests and edges and clearings in dense forest, including conifer forests and boreal taiga. It is also found more widely in plantations, hedgerows, orchards, parks, gardens, the edges of cultivation, olive groves and almost any group of trees or bushes. In Europe shows preference for oaks (Quercus) (Gosler et al. 2013). Egg-laying begins in March to April in southern lowlands and in May in the north but over most of Europe it begins in April (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is built by the female, mostly of plant fibres, grasses, moss, animal hair, wool and feathers, placed at variable height in a hole or a cavity in a tree, occasionally in a wall, rock face or building. Frequently uses nestboxes (Gosler et al. 2013). Clutches are usually six to eleven eggs in Europe. It feeds on a wide variety of insects, as well as spiders, seeds and fruit (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is generally resident but does undertake seasonal altitudinal movements and is partially eruptive (Gosler et al. 2013).;;Increased spring temperatures are resulting in a mismatch between food availability and offspring requirements leading to lowered reproductive success in at least some populations (Visser et al. 1998, Visser et al. 2006).
B416;Poecile_montanus;This species inhabits lowland, submontane and montane forests and woodlands, principally coniferous forests of pine (Pinus), larch (Larix) and spruce (Picea), and in Siberian taiga it is most frequently in steppe-forest of Siberian stone pine (Pinus sibirica). It is also often in dense and damp areas, especially Sphagnum bogs and areas of willows (Salix) or alders (Alnus) and on tundra edge. In Europe also occurs in willows, alders and more shrubby vegetation, including elder (Sambucus) patches, edges of woods, copses, and hedges, especially along rivers and beside lakes. It occurs from sea-level to tree-line up to c. 2,000 m. It breeds from April to July and is monogamous, forming a pair-bond for life. The female builds the nest which is constructed mostly of bark or wood strips, grass, plant fibres, animal hair and feathers (rarely, moss included). It is placed in a hole or crevice up to 3 m (often less than 1 m, exceptionally to 10 m) from the ground in a rotting tree trunk or old stump. The hole is excavated by both sexes or may be adapted from an existing one. Clutch size is five to nine eggs. It feeds mostly on invertebrates and larvae but also vegetable matter. It also stores food behind loose bark, under branches, in bud capsules or in lichen and rarely in the ground in a steep bank. In Norway most food is cached between August and September (Gosler and Clement 2007). The species is highly sedentary and most movements, which are generally less than 5 km, are considered post-fledging dispersal (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Habitat loss and degradation are implicated in the decline and there is also recent evidence that increased competition from other parids, which evict this species from nest-holes, and increased nest predation by Great Spotted Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos major) are also important factors, exacerbated by the low dispersability of the species that makes recolonisation difficult after local extinction (Gosler et al. 2013). The species may also be threatened by future climate change (Harrison et al. 2003, Siriwardena 2011).
B415;Poecile_palustris;The species inhabits lowland to submontane and montane mature deciduous woodland and forest with relatively high proportion of dead or rotting trees and open undergrowth. It is often found in large areas of oak (Quercus) and beech (Fagus), also mixed forest, riverine alder (Alnus) carr, and forests of poplar (Populus), birch (Betula), willow (Salix) and bird cherry (Prunus padus) and is also occasionally seen in wooded edges of cultivation, orchards, parks and large gardens. It breeds from late March to June and is monogamous, pairing for life. The nest is a cup or pad of moss, plant material, animal hair and feathers, in a hole in a tree or stump or among upturned tree roots. It also less frequently uses a cavity in a wall or a hole in the the ground. Clutches are generally five to ten eggs. It feeds chiefly on small invertebrates as well as vegetable matter, including fruits and seeds. The species is mostly resident, although juveniles undertake short-distance post-breeding dispersal (Gosler et al. 2013).;;The species suffers from habitat loss and fragmentation through urbanisation, agricultural intensification and the replacement of deciduous forest with coniferous. Sever winters cause mortality and are a particular threat to small isolated populations. The species’s extremely low colonization rate means although suitable habitat areas may exist, they may not be colonized for a long time (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Increased predator pressure (Siriwardena 2006) and competition from other parids may affect the species (Perrins 2003).
B506;Montifringilla_nivalis;This species occupies barren rocky ground with cliffs, as well as meadows above the tree-line and up to the snow-line. It is frequently found near buildings where these are present at high altitudes (Summers-Smith and Bonan 2013). Breeding occurs from May to June. The nest is placed in a crevice or cavity in a rock face, boulder scree, earth bank or similar and is a bulky but neat construction of dry grass with roots, plant stalks, moss and lichen, lined with fine plant material, feathers wool and hair. Clutches are four or five eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds mainly on seeds in the winter and insects at other times of the year. It also takes scraps at ski resorts. The species is manly resident but descends to lower altitudes in winter (Summers-Smith and Bonan 2013).;;This species is threatened by the future effects of climate change (Smith et al. 2009, Maggini et al. 2014).
B499;Passer_domesticus;This species is often associated with man, living around buildings from isolated farms to urban centres and showing a preference for suburbs. In the south of its range it is more frequently found in open country, and has been recorded as breeding in small isolated colonies away from humans. It breeds from February to September, although timing varies with latitude. It breeds in loose colonies and nests are constructed mainly of plant stems, lined with feathers or other soft material. Its preferred site is a hole in a building, cliff or tree. Clutches are two to five eggs. The diet is mainly vegetable material, particularly seeds of grasses, cultivated cereals and low herbs, but also buds, berries and wide range of household scraps. It does take some animal matter (c. 10% of the diet in summer months). The species is mostly resident (Summers-Smith et al. 2013).;;Declines in western Europe have been attributed to a decrease in availability of suitable invertebrate food necessary for rearing young as well as possible reduced fitness of those young that fledge successfully (Summers-Smith et al. 2013). This may be as a result of changes in agricultural practices such as the increased use of pesticides and herbicides and the autumn sowing of cereals which have lead to decreases in food for this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B500;Passer_hispaniolensis;This species is found mainly in moist, humid areas near water with trees and shrubs and is normally associated with cultivation, extending in places into more arid steppe and semi-desert and penetrating urban areas where Passer domesticus is lacking. Breeding occurs mainly from April to August in the west of its range and it breeds colonially. The nest is a loosely woven, roughly spherical structure 15–30 cm in diameter and made of grass and other plant stems, lined with finer grasses and feathers. It is firmly attached to branches of a tree, in the lower part of large nest of bird of prey, crow (Corvidae) or heron (Ardeidae), or on a pylon.  Clutches are two to six eggs. It feeds mostly on vegetable matter, especially seeds of grasses, cultivated crops and low herbs, but it also takes invertebrates throughout year. The species is variously resident, nomadic and migratory (Summers-Smith 2009).;It is rarely in a hole in a wall or building.;On Madeira, the species has declined almost to extinction as a result of the wide-spread use of pesticides (Summers-Smith 2009).
B501;Passer_moabiticus;This species inhabits riverine or lacustrine areas with trees or scrub, and irrigated semi-desert with flushes of annual grasses. Outside breeding season in cultivated land. Unusually for the genus, it has no association with built-up areas or habitations. It breeds from March to July. The nest is a large ovoid structure, domed and with an entrance spiralling down from top. It is strongly constructed from dead twigs, lined with feathers and plant down and built openly in the branches of a tree, often a dead tree standing in water. Clutches are three to five eggs. The diet is primarily seeds and it specializes on the smaller seeds of grasses, rushes and sedges, shrubs and trees. The species is migratory and partially migratory (Summers-Smith 2009).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004). Habitat degradation from factors such as irrigation, overgrazing and erosion as well as  are recorded in areas where the species in present (Ozturk et al. 2012) and may be a threat to this species. The use of pesticides may also be a problem (Ozturk et al. 2012). In Cyprus, a local extinction occurred at a lake near Akrotiri in the 1980s when the lake dried out (Summers-Smith 2009)."
B502;Passer_montanus;In the west of its range this species is found mainly in cultivated areas with hedgerow trees, orchards, gardens and farmyards and less commonly in light woodland. In the east it is found increasingly not only in built-up areas, but also in open arid country. In the north of its range the breeding season begins from April or May. It breeds in loose colonies. The nest is constructed of dried grass and rootlets, lined with feathers and animal fur and is domed (even when in a hole), with as entrance on the side. It is mostly sited in a hole in a tree, earth bank, cliff or artificial structure, sometimes in the base of a large nest of heron (Ardeidae), crow (Corvidae) or bird of prey. Occasionally it is a free-standing nest in a tree, but then usually hidden in thick conifer or creepers.  Clutches are two to seven eggs. The diet is mainly seeds and it prefers smaller seeds of low herbs and grasses, including cultivated cereals but it also takes a significant proportion of animal food (Summers-Smith 2009). In Europe the species is largely sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Declines in this species may be a result of changes in agricultural practices such as the increased use of pesticides and herbicides and the autumn sowing of cereals which have lead to decreases in food for this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B505;Carpospiza_brachydactyla;This species breeds in arid regions with sparse bushy vegetation, often in sparsely grassed hilly and mountainous areas, and rocky ravines. In the north of its range, breeding occurs in July. It nests in loose colonies and the nest is an open, bulky, untidy hemisphere of thorny twigs, plant stems and grass, lined with plant down and animal hair. It is set in a bush or sometimes in a crevice in a rock or a hole in a building. Clutches are three to six eggs. This diet is mostly plant matter, mainly seeds, including cultivated cereals and the green parts of plants but is also known to take insects in the breeding season. The species is migratory, wintering mainly in western Saudi Arabia and north-east Africa (Summers-Smith 2013).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B504;Petronia_petronia;The species is normally found in bare treeless country, ranging from flat desert steppe to rocky slopes and ravines. In Spain, it is common in open woodland or parkland, such as of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). It also often forages in large open areas of cultivation, vineyards, olive groves, near old buildings and even penetrates into human settlements. It breeds from March to August in loose colonies or isolated pairs. The nest is an untidy structure, sometimes domed and made from grass, lined with feathers, animal hair and wool. It is set in a crack or crevice in a rock or tree, or in a wall or roof of an isolated and ruined building or occasionally in an occupied building.  Clutches are four to seven eggs. The diet is mostly seeds of low herbs and grasses, as well as small berries and it also takes animal matter in the breeding season, such as termites (Isoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera). The species is resident and a partial migrant, with some post-breeding dispersal and descent to lower altitudes in the winter (Summers-Smith 2009).;;Declines in the Canary Islands are considered due to competition from the introduced Passer hispaniolensis (Summers-Smith 2009).
B503;Gymnoris_xanthocollis;This species is found in open country and low hills with trees and river bottoms with trees, as well as cultivated areas with scattered trees or hedgerows, villages and inhabited areas with gardens (Summers-Smith 2009). The time of breeding in Europe is not recorded but breeds from late April to late July in Iraq (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest ranges from being a small pad of hair, feathers and grass to being an untidy mass of dry grass, wool and hair, lined with feathers, that fills the cavity in which it is placed. It is usually sited in a covered site, including a crevice in tree or a hole in a wall or building and also in the old nest of other species. Clutches are generally three to four eggs. It feeds on plant matter, mainly seeds, including those of cultivated cereals, as well as small berries and nectar. In the breeding season it also takes insects (Summers-Smith 2009). The species is migratory in the western Palearctic (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B331;Prunella_atrogularis;During the breeding season this species favours low, thick, thorny scrub. It is found in clumps of stunted spruce (Picea) in subalpine zone in Urals (Hatchwell and de Juana 2014) as well as in mountain larch (Larix) forests and willow Salix bushes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It breeds from May to August and is thought to be monogamous. The nest is a bulky cup of moss, twigs, grasses and stems, lined with fine grass and hairs and placed in a tree or a shrub, most often in spruce or juniper. Clutches are three to five eggs. It feeds mainly on insects and other small arthropods, worms and snails. The species is migratory (Hatchwell and de Juana 2014).; and avoids open habitats;The species’s habitat is not threatened and the species is not currently threatened (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B328;Prunella_collaris;"During the breeding season this species is found principally in areas with low cliffs, screes, rocky mountain slopes and alpine meadows above tree-line and up to snow-line often close to snow patches. It breeds almost exclusively in mountain ranges; at 1,800–3,000 m in Switzerland, Caucasus and Pyrenees. Outside the breeding season, it usually occurs at lower elevations in rocky and scrubby habitats, often close to human habitation in villages and near livestock, including woodland edges, roadsides, gardens and farms. It breeds from May to August and is polygynandrous. The nest is a cup made from grass, moss and plant stems, lined with hair and feathers and sited in a rock crevice or beneath a rock or grass tussock on a cliff or shallower slope. It lays three to four eggs. It feeds mainly on insects as well as spiders, small snails, earthworms and some vegetable matter. The species is resident or an altitudinal migrant, on local scale but in some areas it migrates over a considerable distance (Hatchell and Christie 2013).";;Populations vary greatly annually, most likely as a result of differences in weather conditions and snow cover. Locally, outside the breeding season, predation by cats and other predators is thought to be behind declines (Hatchell and Christie 2013). The species is also threatened by disturbance from recreational activities and development (Cichocki 2004).
B332;Prunella_modularis;"This species is found in a wide variety of habitats across its range. It breeds in scrubby habitats, extensive marshlands and in the Mediterranean area, lowlands and semi-arid plains. It is typically a woodland species in much of Europe but in the North Sea countries it is most common in farmland, favouring hedges, scattered bushes and farmsteads  and suburban areas, where it is common in cemeteries, parks, orchards and gardens (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It breeds from March to July across Europe except in Russia where breeding is from May to August. The nest is a cup of twigs, stems, roots, grass and moss, lined with hair, wool and sometimes feathers, located above the ground in a bush, hedge or tree. It lays three to six eggs. It feeds mainly on arthropods but supplements its diet with seeds in the winter (Hatchwell 2005). In western Europe the species is resident; in western-central Europe it is partially migratory, making altitudinal movements in montane areas; in Fennoscandia and central Europe it is fully migratory (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;The decline in the U.K. is thought to be due to changing farming practices which has allowed other passerines to force this species into more marginal sites (Hagemeijer and Blair). However no specific factor has been found for these local declines (Hatchwell 2005).
B329;Prunella_montanella;This species breeds in the boreal and subarctic, principally along the northern limits of coniferous and deciduous forests, in valleys, often close to riverbanks in dense tangles of bushes and trees such as willow (Salix). It is also found in spruce (Picea) taiga, and on mountains to the tree-line in sparse spruce and birch (Betula) woodland. The breeding season is from June to August. The nest is a compact cup of twigs, moss, leaves and plant stems, lined with fine grasses and hairs and built in the fork of a low tree or in a thick shrub. It lays four to six eggs. The diet consists mostly of insects, on which the young are fed on as well. The species is migratory (Hatchwell 2005).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species, however due to the size of the European population it is susceptible to the risks affecting small populations (Birdlife International 2004). As a northern breeding species it is likely vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
B330;Prunella_ocularis;The species breeds in rocky pastureland with scattered barberry (Berberis) bushes, in Turkey. In Transcaucasia, it breeds on rocky mountain slopes with scrubby juniper (Juniperus), cedar (Cedrus) and other vegetation and in the winter, it is also found in shrubby areas adjacent to mountain streams. Its breeding habits are not well documented. Nests have been found between June and August and they are a cup of twigs, leaves and stems, lined with hair, wool, grass and moss, placed low down in low bush. Clutches are three to four eggs. The diet includes insects and seeds. The species is most likely resident with altitudinal movement and some short-distance migration (Hatchwell 2005).;;The main threat to this species is thought to be due to habitat degradation in lower-lying non-breeding areas (Hatchwell 2005) from intensive pastoral farming and the associated increases in burning and cutting of bushes, which serve as the only secure nesting places for the species. Intensive cattle-grazing also increases the risk of nest predation by weasels (Mustela nivalis) and corvids such as Magpies (Pica pica) (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B322;Pycnonotus_xanthopygos;This species occupies a wide range of well-vegetated areas with low trees and bushes, in both natural vegetation and cultivation, including open pine (Pinus) woods, juniper (Juniperus) forest, Ceratonia scrub, oases, orchards, groves, fields, gardens and villages. The species breeds from the end of March to August and is monogamous. The nest is a cup or small basket of thin twigs, grass stems, moss and leaves with the base constructed of broad leaves (sometimes with newspaper, strips of plastic or cotton wool) and the structure is held together by cobwebs and cotton threads, lined after a fashion with hair, shredded bark and rootlets, apparently sometimes unlined. Clutches are two to four eggs. It feeds mostly on fruit, as well as seeds and invertebrates and less frequently, nectar, leaves and flowers. The species is mainly resident, although some local movements occur in search of fruit sources and altitudinal migration may occur in Turkey (Fishpool and Tobias 2005).;;"The species is considered an agricultural pest in some places; however this has not impacted population numbers (Fishpool and Tobias 2005)."
B324;Regulus_ignicapilla;This species is found in coniferous forest with spruce (Picea) and fir (Abies) and is fairly common in mixed forest, as well as in deciduous stands with only a few mature conifers interspersed. In the Mediterranean region it uses cork oak (Quercus suber) and holly oak (Quercus ilex) stands. Breeding begins in April and continue until August. The nest is a typical regulid cup of three layers, made of moss, lichen, feathers and spider web, inner cushion layer with fewer and larger feathers and outer covering of lichens. It is suspended 9–18 m above the ground in the vertical twigs of a conifer or, if no conifers are present, in a climbing plant or in deciduous tree, especially oak. Clutches are six to thirteen eggs. It feeds on arthropods, such as moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera), aphids (Aphidoidea) and spiders (Araneae). The species is primarily migratory (Martens and Päckert 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B323;Regulus_regulus;This species is found in boreal forests dominated by Norway Spruce (Picea abies) and fir (Abies). On Atlantic islands it uses laurel (Laurus) forest or pine (Pinus) stands with well-developed undergrowth of tree-heath (Erica), but also conifer stands of indigenous short-leaved juniper (Juniperus brevifolia) or introduced Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). Outside breeding season, and especially during migration, it will use mixed and deciduous forests, shrub vegetation and gardens and parks. Nesting begins the end of March and both sexes build the nest (Martens and Päckert 2006), which is an almost spherical cup of moss, lichens, cobwebs, feathers, and hair, in three distinct layers and with a small entrance at the top. Clutches are typically nine to eleven eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds mainly on arthropods and is generally adapted to small-sized prey. The species is mostly migratory (Martens and Päckert 2006).;;Severe winter conditions, particularly if they persist for lengthy periods over wide areas of the non-breeding range, can significantly reduce population levels, however it is capable of rapid recovery (Martens and Päckert 2006).
B431;Remiz_pendulinus;This species favours lakeside and riverine swampy vegetation and a good mixture of emergent vegetation, including reeds (Phragmites), with reedmace (Typha), poplars (Populus) and willows (Salix). It can be monogamous, but is often polygamous or polyandrous and egg-laying begins in late April and continues to the beginning of July (Madge 2008). The nest is a large, free-hanging domed pouch-like structure, with a short downward-projecting entrance tube near the top. It is made of plant fibres mixed with plant down and animal hair and lined with plant down and occasionally feathers. Clutches are generally six to eight eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds on small invertebrates, particularly the larvae of small insects and will also consume seeds. Northern populations of this species are highly migratory while southern populations are generally resident (Madge 2008).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B423;Sitta_europaea;"This species inhabits mature forest with large old trees and a well-developed canopy providing extensive foraging areas, as well as nesting cavities. In much of Europe it prefers deciduous and mixed forest, especially oak (Quercus), but is also found in riverine woodland, parkland, old orchards, cemeteries, and sometimes large gardens and locally occupies in old spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus) forests, especially in the mountains. Egg-laying occurs mainly from late-April to May but varies with latitude and altitude. The nest is a foundation of wood chips surmounted by bark flakes and rarely incorporating dry leaves, lichen, conifer ­needles and the like. It is sited in the hole in a tree, which is either natural or, more often an abandoned woodpecker hole. On occasion it will use a nestbox or a wall cavity, hole in a rock face or building or crevice between tree roots. Clutches are typically five to nine eggs. It feeds on insects but in the autumn and winter it takes seeds, nuts and sometimes flower buds and sap. It will readily visit birdtables in the winter. The species is generally sedentary, but juveniles may disperse over short distances in late summer and autumn; occasionally these movements become irruptive (Harrap 2008).";;The main threat to this species is forest destruction and fragmentation, which has lead to local declines and extinctions throughout its range. It is generally rare or absent from small forest fragments and the species does not inhabit areas without mature trees (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Harrap 2008).
B425;Sitta_krueperi;This species inhabits temperate coniferous forest, from sea-level up to c. 2,400 m. In Turkey, it occurs mostly between 1,000–1,600 m, mainly in forests of black pine (Pinus nigra), fir (Abies cilicica), cedar (Cedrus libani), red pine (Pinus brutia) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) (Albayrak et al. 2006, T. Albayrak in litt. 2007). In the Caucasus, it occurs mainly in the zone of spruce (Picea) forests between 1,000 and 2,000 m, mostly in old stands of Caucasian fir (Abies nordmanniana), but also in pine (Pinus) forest. The breeding season is from early April to mid-May (depending on altitude and locality) on Lesbos and in Turkey and April to May in Caucasus. The nest is built largely by the female and is a foundation of coarse bark chips, rotten wood and cone scales, lined with a pad of moss, bark fibres, hair, wool, fur and feathers. Nests are built up to 24 m above ground in tree holes although eggs are sometimes laid on top of a stump or even in pile of twigs in a fork (perhaps only when holes not available). It feeds largely on insects and spiders in the breeding season and chicks are fed entirely on animal material. In autumn and winter it feeds on the seeds of coniferous trees and will cache food for times of poor weather (Harrap 2008). The species is primarily sedentary but some altitudinal movement occurs in the winter (Tucker and Heath 1994).;;In Turkey, forestry is placing considerable pressure on the species's mature coniferous forest habitats (T. Albayrak in litt. 2007). Development for tourism is also a threat, particularly in coastal areas where the species was once numerous (S. Isfendiyaroglu in litt. 2005). A law for the promotion of tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threat from habitat loss (S. Isfendiyaroglu in litt. 2005). Urbanisation and the construction of summer houses is also a growing problem in the Mediterranean part of its range (S. Isfendiyaroglu in litt. 2005).
B426;Sitta_neumayer;This species occupies barren regions and areas with low shrubs, herbs and grasses, and is occasionally found in woodland with scattered rocks. It chooses sites with bare rocks, typically rocky slopes, cliffs and gorges in dry or arid regions, including walls, old buildings and ancient ruins. The breeding season is from late March to April or May. The nest is built mainly by the male and is a remarkable flask-shaped structure, with an entrance tunnel up to 10 cm long and is sited on a rock face, usually under a slight overhang or sometimes on a building or other man-made structure. It is built of mud, animal dung, hair, feathers, beetle wings and similar materials. The chamber is lined with hair, wool, feathers and grass. The surrounding area is sometimes decorated with various objects, both natural and man-made. Clutches are four to ten eggs (Harrap 2008). In the summer it feeds mainly on insects and in the autumn and winter mostly on seeds, although snails are also important (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is sedentary, showing limited post-breeding dispersal (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;There are currently no known significant threats to this species.
B427;Sitta_tephronota;This is a species of rocky mountain slopes and valleys, cliffs, ravines and gorges. It may favour streams, and its distribution is closely correlated to a milk-vetch-wormwood-Rosaceae (Astragalus-Artemesia-Rosaceae) vegetation community, including almonds (Prunus dulcis) and pistachios (Pistacia vera). In the Transcaucasus area breeding begins from late March or April. Both sexes build the nest, which is a flask-shaped structure built usually over a crack, cavity or hole in rock face, tree, riverbank or building. The hole may be a natural one, excavated by birds themselves, or the abandoned hole another species. The entrance is walled up with a mixture of mud, saliva, excrement, resin, feathers, hair, cloth, insect fragments and even sweet papers, leaving a small hole or short conical entrance tunnel. The nest may be reused over several years. Clutches are typically five to seven eggs. In the summer it feeds mainly on insects and snails (Gastropoda) and from autumn to early spring it takes mostly seeds, such as those of apricot (Prunus armeniaca), cherry (Prunus) and wild almond. The species is resident with some post-breeding dispersal (Harrap 2008).;;The species may suffer the effects of future climate change (Menon et al. 2009).
B424;Sitta_whiteheadi;Optimal habitat for this species is mature stands of Corsican pine with abundant dead and rotting trunks for nest sites, at elevations of 1,000-1,500 m (Harrap and de Juana 2013). Densities vary between 0.2–3.8 pairs/10 ha, and correlate with tree height, vegetation density and dead tree distribution (Thibault and Bonaccorsi 1999). Suboptimal habitats include forests where Corsican pine is associated with cluster pine (Pinus pinaster), balsam fir (Abies alba) or beech (Fagus sylvatica), and younger, exploited stands of Corsican pine at elevations of 600–1,700 m. Dispersing birds may be found in holm oak (Quercus ilex) and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) forests, gardens and orchards (Thibault and Bonaccorsi 1999, Harrap and de Juana 2013). Its breeding season stretches from April to May, laying a clutch of five to six eggs, with mated partners remaining on their territory all year. It feeds largely on insects and spiders during May-August, switching to seeds, especially those of the Corsican pine, during the rest of the year. It forages singly or in pairs, though may join mixed-species flocks outside the breeding season. Seeds are cached from late autumn to early spring during periods of sunny weather (when the cones are open) and retrieved during wet or cold weather (Harrap and de Juana 2013). It is generally sedentary except for some dispersal of immature and unmated birds to lower altitudes in winter (Thibault and Bonaccorsi 1999).;;Forest fires and logging of mature Corsican pine stands appear to be the primary threats to this species. Large trees suitable for the species are also favoured by the logging industry and since the 1970s local foresters have attempted to rejuvenate the pine forest by shortening the logging rotation, reducing the size of trees available for the species (Bourcet 1996). It has been estimated that 78-122 territories have been destroyed by logging since 1998, and that a further 50-63 territories were lost during the large forest fires of 2000 and 2003, which severely affected another 47-80 territories (Thibault et al. 2004, 2010). It has been predicted that whenever an area 2 ha is logged in a forest stand suitable for the species, a potential territory is likely to disappear for more than a century due to the slow growth of Corsican Pine (Thibault et al. 2010). This species is potentially susceptible to climate change through sea-level rise and shifts in suitable climatic conditions (affecting Corsican pine distribution), however this is not expected to be a serious direct threat (Barbet-Massin and Jiguet 2011, BirdLife International unpublished data). Climate change may also cause an increase in fire frequency and intensity and so could be a serious future threat to the species (J.Baudat-Franceschi in litt. 2010, Barbet-Massin and Jiguet 2011). Climate change may increase interspecific competition between Corsican pine and Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) as well as Mediterranean shrub species which in turn could have a negative effect on the species's range (Thibault et al. 2010, J. Baudat-Franceschi in litt. 2012).
B428;Tichodroma_muraria;This species inhabits a range of rocky regions, typically including steep, rugged cliffs, boulder-strewn slopes, and damp, shady gorges in mountainous areas, with holes and crevices for nesting and roosting. Grassy ledges generally intersperse the rocks and other vegetation including herbaceous plants, moss, shrubs and trees, and running water are often present. For foraging areas of mixed sunlight and shade are important. In the winter, similar rocky habitats are favoured. In Europe, the breeding season is from April and May to July and August, depending on altitude. The nest is made of moss, plant fibres, rootlets and grass, with hair, wool and feathers densely matted together, sometimes as a lining for insulation. It is sited in a cleft in a rock, between or behind rocks or boulders and sometimes on or inside a building. Clutches are three to five eggs. It feeds principally on small and some larger insects, including adults, larvae and eggs, as well as spiders (Araneae) and some other invertebrates. Through most of its range the species is a short-distance and altitudinal migrant (Löhrl and Wilson 2008).;;The species is under threat from the development of mountain regions (Löhrl and Wilson 2008), such as dam building (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and a considerable increase in human leisure activities, especially rock-climbing, which cause disturbance and threaten habitat in breeding and wintering areas (Löhrl and Wilson 2008).
B450;Pastor_roseus;During the breeding season this species is found on open steppes where orthopterans (locusts and other grasshoppers) are abundant. Colonies are normally found near water, often in valleys but after breeding it moves to more wooded areas. The breeding season is short, running from May to July and is closely tied to the availability of food. It is monogamous and breeds in large colonies often from hundreds to several thousand nests. Both sexes build the nest, which is made from grasses and twigs, lined with finer grasses and feathers and the cup may include aromatic plants such as wormwood (Artemisia), giant fennel (Ferula) and the poaceous grass (Aeluropus). It is sited in a hole, most frequently between stones on scree slope and sometimes in a crack in a rock or cliff, among stones on a railway embankment or quarry, in a hole or crevice in a building. Clutches are from three to six eggs. It feeds on insects during the breeding season, mostly locusts and other grasshoppers but more fruit is taken after breeding, and in winter it consumes insects, fruit, seeds and nectar. The species is migratory and also undertakes nomadic post-breeding dispersal (Craig et al. 2013).;;The species may be threatened by habitat modification (Birdlife International 2015).
B452;Sturnus_unicolor;"This species is found in open woodland with expanses of short grass, often in association with grazing mammals as well as in farmland, parks, gardens and cities. Breeding occurs from April to mid-July and it is a colonial nester. Both sexes build the nest, mainly from dry grass and it is lined with grass, roots, leaves and feathers. Often yellow flowers are included in the structure, as well as fresh green leaves. It is placed in a natural hole or an old woodpecker hole, or in the disused burrow of European Bee-eater (Merops apiaster) or Collared Sand Martin (Riparia riparia) and artificial structures and nestboxes are widely used. Clutches are four to five eggs in Spain. It is omnivorous; it takes mainly animal matter in the spring and summer and fruit and seeds in the autumn and winter. The species is mostly sedentary (Craig et al. 2014).";;Interbreeding between this species and Sturnus vulgaris has been observed in areas where it is sympatric (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), although this is not known to be a serious threat.
B451;Sturnus_vulgaris;During the breeding season this species occupies open country, including modified habitats, with access to suitable nesting and roosting sites. It requires cavity nest-sites, typically in woodland or on man-made structures, close to open areas of short grassland for foraging. At other times it exploits a wide range of habitats, including moorland, saltmarshes, seashore and tidal flats, stubble fields, orchards, refuse dumps and sewage-treatment works. It roosts in reedbeds, scrub and trees, as well as bridges and buildings and even in town centres. Breeding occurs mostly between March and July. The nest is a bulky structure of dry grass, conifer needles, twigs, string and other materials and the cup is lined with softer materials such as grass, feathers, moss, wool, hair and paper, fresh green leaves and flowers. It is typically built in a hole in a tree, cliff, building or other structure and nestboxes are also readily used. Clutches are normally four to six eggs (Craig and Feare 2009). It omnivorous, taking animal and plant material all year round but during the spring animal food predominates and is fed almost exclusively to nestlings (Snow and Perrins 1998). In the northern and eastern populations are migratory where as southern and western populations as well as those in urban areas tend to be resident (Craig and Feare 2009).;;The species is thought to be declining in some areas owing to the intensification and specialization of agriculture and consequent changes in rural habitats (Craig and Feare 2009), such as decreases in fallow and grassland and increases in autumn-sown arable crops (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Declines have coincided with a reduction in cattle farming. In some European countries it was formerly a regular food source and was also kept as a cagebird (Craig and Feare 2009).
B353;Acrocephalus_agricola;This species breeds in reeds (Phragmites), chiefly low-growing and open, as well as reedmace (Typha) and neighbouring bushes or tamarisks (Tamarix), often on the landward edges of lakes and in river valleys. Around the Black Sea, breeding begins in mid-May. Three to six eggs are laid in a cylindrical, rather tall and deep nest, which is loosely constructed from reed and grass stems and leaves and reed inflorescences, woven around vertical stems of water plants and lined with finer grasses, reed flowers and occasionally plant down. It is suspended over land or water, 10–200 cm up among vertical stems of emergent aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation (Dyrcz 2006). It feeds mainly on insects (Snow and Perrins 1998) but also takes spiders (Araneae) and earthworms (Dyrcz 2006). The species is migratory, wintering in the Indian subcontinent (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In Bulgaria this species has been adversely affected by large-scale reed-cutting and burning (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B357;Acrocephalus_arundinaceus;This species breeds mainly in beds of reed (Phragmites), locally in stands of reedmace (Typha), growing in fresh or brackish water. It shows a preference for tall reeds with thick stems, especially next to open water. In western and central Europe, egg-laying occurs from mid-May to July but begins earlier in southern Europe from early May. It lays three to six eggs in a nest, which is a deep, cylindrical cup of coarsely woven grass, reed and other plants stems and leaves, some plant down, spider webs and reed flowers and lined with finer plant material, sometimes also hair and feathers. It is built 10–200 cm above water and attached to several reed stems. The diet is mainly insects but also includes spiders (Araneae), some snails and small vertebrates. Outside the breeding season it also rarely takes fruit and berries. The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Dyrcz 2006).; and rarely, in willow bushes (Salix);The reasons of declines in Europe are not clear but may be due to climate change and habitat loss. Drainage and irrigation, decreasing reed quality, lower arthropod densities (Dyrcz 2006), land reclamation, eutrophication and reedbed die-back may be causes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B355;Acrocephalus_dumetorum;"This species has adapted to varied habitats and is not necessarily found close to water; it is more arboreal than most members of the genus (Dyrcz 2006). It breeds in a wide range of shrubby growth with tall herbage, young forests, overgrown clearings, birch (Betula) and willow (Salix) scrub in floodland groves, forest steppes, bush-encroached farmland and swamp and other waterside margins (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The breeding season is from the end of May to July. It lays three to six eggs is a nest, which is a neat and compact cup of dry grass stalks and leaves, rootlets, plant fibres, spider web, lined with finer stems and hair and suspended 10–150 cm above ground in a dense herbaceous layer, or sometimes in a shrub or small tree. It feeds mainly on insects but also consumes spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones), snails and occasionally seeds. The species is migratory and the entire population winters in the Indian Subcontinent (Dyrcz 2006).";;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B350;Acrocephalus_melanopogon;This species occupies low aquatic vegetation, especially reedbeds, but also rush stands, sedges, reedmace (Typha) and others, often with admixture of bushes or tamarisks (Tamarix). Its optimal habitat appears to be old reedbeds containing a high proportion of dead material and a complex lower stratum, with tall reeds above. In addition it is found along lake margins, ditches, beside freshwater and brackish marshes, and in very small reed marshes in steppe zone. In Europe, egg-laying begins in late March and continues to mid-June. The nest is a deep cup, sometimes with a partial roof and is made of loosely woven leaves and stems of aquatic plants, lined with fine plant material and some feathers. It is suspended 30–130 cm above water from several vertical plant stems. Clutches are usually from three to six eggs. The diet is almost entirely small arthropods, especially small beetles but the fruits of cherry (Prunus) and elder (Sambucus) are also taken. The species is sedentary, partially migratory and migratory in Europe (Dyrcz 2006).;;This species is threatened locally by fires caused by humans. Although burnt reedbeds are quickly recolonized, the complex lower stratum that this species favours is lost (Dyrcz 2006). The modification of wetland habitats, water abstraction (Martí del Mora 2003, Madroño et al. 2005) and the mowing and cutting of reeds (Flitti et al. 2009) also pose a risk to this species.
B351;Acrocephalus_paludicola;This species breeds in large open lowland marsh habitats with low grassy vegetation (mostly sedge fen mires) with water mostly less than 10 cm deep (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999). On migration, it favours coastal habitats with low stands of sedge and reed near open water (Flade et al. 2011). The species has an unusual reproductive system close to promiscuity, the female raising young without male help. This strategy is possibly explained and facilitated by high density of potential prey (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Nests are often concentrated in loose clusters at places where food resources are rich. The nest is a cup constructed of grass, plant stems and leaves, spider webs and plant down and lined with finer material, placed 3–30 cm above swampy ground or water, often under roof of dead sedges. Clutch size ranges from three to six eggs. In studies in north-east Poland, the earliest clutch started 9th May and the mean first-egg date in consecutive years was between 15th and 22nd May. Second broods are less synchronous. It feeds on a wide variety of species of spiders and insects as well as small water snails (Dyrcz et al. 2013). The species is migratory. Central European populations migrate south-west in the autumn to wintering grounds in western Sahelian wetlands, from Senegal and Mali to Ghana, but extent of wintering area poorly known (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Departure from breeding grounds begins in Poland in late July and continues during August (Dyrcz et al. 2013).;;The most important threats are loss of breeding habitat owing to drainage for agriculture and peat extraction, damming of floodplains, unfavourable water management and the canalisation of rivers. Habitat degradation is widespread where traditional fen management has ceased allowing succession to unsuitable overgrown reedbed, scrub or woodland (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999). Commercial reed cutting can maintain suitable breeding habitat for the species in central Europe, but this is threatened by changes that are likely to occur along with the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (Tanneberger et al. 2009). Uncontrolled fires in spring and summer pose a direct threat to birds and nests, and can burn out the upper peat layer of fens (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999). In the wintering grounds, agricultural cultivation and irrigation, drought, wetland drainage, intensive grazing, succession to scrub, desertification and salinisation of irrigated soils are all potential threats (Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999, M. Flade and L. Lachmann in litt. 2007).
B356;Acrocephalus_palustris;This species favours rank, tufty and fairly tall herbage, especially nettles (Urtica), meadowsweet (Filipendula), brambles (Rubus fruticosus) and others, often in the vicinity of taller bushes or trees. It also occurs in corn fields and other agricultural land surrounded with a belt of low bushes or hedgerows as well as in wasteland with tall grass, herbs and small bushes, in tall herbaceous vegetation along ditches, in marsh vegetation at edges of swamps, in reeds on dry ground and even in gardens. In western and central Europe, breeding occurs from the second half of May to July. It lays three to six eggs in a nest which is a deep, cylindrical cup of leaves and stems of nettles, grass and other plants, lined with finer plant fibres, plant down and hair. The structure is supported on two to five plant stems, usually 30–70 cm high (Dyrcz 2006). It feeds mainly on insects and arachnids, with some snails and occasionally berries in late summer and autumn (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, wintering in south-east Africa (Dyrcz 2006).;;In the U.K., declines during the 1950s and 1960s may have been due to climate change and habitat loss as a result of activities such as bank tidying (Batten et al. 1989). The species is likely still affected by climate change (Both et al. 2010).
B352;Acrocephalus_schoenobaenus;During the breeding season this species is found in a variety of low dense vegetation, often near water or in moist depressions, including shore vegetation around freshwater pools, along rivers and canals, and lowland swamps and marshes with reed and bush thickets. It can also breed in dry situations offering suitable cover, such as neglected orchards, hedgerows, nettlebeds, dense scrub, crop fields. In western Europe egg-laying occurs mainly from the end of April, from early May in central Europe and from mid-May in Finland.  Clutches are from four to seven eggs and are laid in a rather deep cup with a loosely woven outer structure of grass, plant stems and leaves, moss and sedges, often with spider webs and a thick inner layer of finer leaves and stems, lined with reed flowers, hair and plant down. It is generally placed low over marshy ground (rarely above water) among grasses and tall weeds or in low bush. The diet is mainly insects and their larvae but it also takes spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones), small slugs and snails. The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Dyrcz 2006).;;Declines in this species in Europe have been attributed to severe droughts in the west African wintering quarters (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Dyrcz 2006).
B354;Acrocephalus_scirpaceus;This species breeds mainly in mature beds of reed (Phragmites) on the shores of lakes and fish ponds, and along rivers and ditches and locally, breeds in willow bushes in marshland, in reeds on edges of brackish lakes, exceptionally in corn fields. It also forages in adjacent herbaceous vegetation, scrub and low trees, such as willows (Salix). In western and central Europe, breeding occurs from May to July or August. The nest is a deep cup neatly woven from split reed blades, reed inflorescences, plant down and grass stems and lined with finer material. It is suspended from two to eight vertical reed stems, usually 15–200 cm over shallow water. Clutches can be three to five eggs but are most commonly four. The diet is mainly insects and their larvae, spiders (Araneae) and occasionally fruit, seeds and flowers. The species is entirely migratory, wintering in Africa south of the Sahara (Dyrcz et al. 2015).;;The species has declined in some areas due to habitat destruction and the phenomenon of reedbed die-back, caused partly by over-eutrophication (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Reclamation of marshland has contributed to local declines (Dyrcz et al. 2015).
B345;Cettia_cetti;This species favours swampy lowland areas with thick cover of reeds and sparse bushes (rarely in uniform reedbeds standing in water), willows (Salix), and brambles (Rubus) or blackthorn (Prunus spinosa). It is also found in overgrown ditches and streams with thick tangles of cover, areas of damp meadows, tall grass stands, hedgerows and overgrown orchards. In non-breeding areas, occurs in variably wet or dry scrub of plains, foothills, valley bottoms, bramble patches, overgrown orchards, and dense cover near water, marshes, swamps and reeds (Clement 2006). Breeding occurs mainly from mid-April to June (Snow and Perrins 1998) and it lays two to four eggs. The nest is a large untidy cup of leaves, dry grass, plant fibres, feathers, animal hair and reed mace (Typha). It can be sited up to two metres from the ground in a thick tangle of vegetation, among the twigs or thin branches of a bush or stems of reeds or nettles (Urtica) (Clement 2006). It feeds mainly on insects but also takes other invertebrates. The species varies from sedentary to migratory in different parts of its range (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;Particularly in the north-west of its range, it is susceptible to severe cold winters (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Robinson et al. 2007).
B358;Iduna_caligata;This species is found in steppe with low scrub of spirea (Spiraea), pea species (Pisum) and similar species. In the temperate zone it occurs in overgrown pastureland and meadows with dense bushes and weeds (Svensson 2006). Breeding occurs from May to early July. The nest is a well-built cup of twigs, roots, stems and leaves, lined with finer material including feathers, hair and plant down (Snow and Perrins 1998) and placed on or near ground, or up to 1m above it, in dense undergrowth. It feeds principally on insects and other invertebrates. The species is a long-distance migrant, wintering in India (Svensson 2006).;;In some areas of Russia, nest predation by predators such as Common Viper (Vipera berus), Harriers and Corvids has a variable annual pressure but may have a significant impact locally (Shitikov et al. 2012).
B363;Hippolais_icterina;This species inhabits tall-grown woods of oak (Quercus), birch (Betula), beech (Fagus sylvatica), alder (Alnus) and other deciduous trees, but it is also found in larger parks and gardens, and in stands of young pines (Pinus) if mixed with broadleaf trees. It favours open forest, or dense woods with intermixed glades and undergrowth. Breeding occurs from the end of May to June and clutches are four to five. The nest is a strong cup of grasses, plant stems, moss and soft twigs, often covered with pieces of birch bark, lichens, flowers and similar, partly attached with cobwebs and lined with fine fibres, roots, fur and similar soft material. It is placed in the fork of a tree branch. The diet is mostly insects and other invertebrates but in the summer it also takes fruits and berries. The species is migratory, wintering in Africa, south of the equator (Svensson 2006).;;Decreases in the west and south-west of it range may be in part due to competition from Hippolais polyglotta, which has spread north and east to become marginally sympatric (Svensson 2006).
B360;Hippolais_languida;This species favours trees and tall bushes in variety of habitats: orchards, plantations, maquis on mountain slopes, scattered trees at desert edge, riverine forest in valleys. It is often associated with elevated ground, in mountains and on arid, rocky slopes with sufficient taller vegetation and nearness of water. Breeding occurs from April to July and clutches are three to five eggs. The nest is a strong, neat cup of grasses, plant stems and soft twigs, often covered with cobwebs, lined with fine fibres, plant down, fur and similar soft material and placed in fork of branch. It is thought to feed mainly on insects and other invertebrates. The species is migratory and winters in east Africa (Svensson 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B361;Hippolais_olivetorum;This species inhabits orchards of almond (Prunus dulcis), olive (Olea) and pistachio (Pistacia vera), open oak (Quercus) woods, maquis on mountain slopes, savanna-like open woods and sparse trees on grassland, and similar. The presence of some taller trees is preferred. Breeding occurs from May to June. The nest is a well-built, deep cup of grasses, plant stems and soft twigs, often covered with cobwebs and lined with fine fibres, plant down, fur and similar soft material. It is sited in the fork of a branch of a tree. Clutches are three or four eggs. It is thought to mainly feed on insects and other invertebrates, and in the summer it also takes fruits and berries, including figs (Ficus). The species is migratory, wintering in southern Africa (Svensson 2006).;;The ecology of this species is not well known, however it may be threatened by changes in habitat structure, especially from clearance and thinning of woodland and agricultural intensification in olive-groves and fruit plantations. Agricultural pesticide use may decrease insect prey numbers. In addition, bird trapping in Greece may impact the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B359;Iduna_pallida;This species prefers trees and tall bushes in variety of habitats: dense gardens, parks, riverine forest, often of poplars (Populus), also dense tall bushes or trees at lakesides, orchards and plantations, including young pine trees (Pinus). It is also found in maquis of oak (Quercus), roses (Rosa), low pines, brooms (Cytisus) and similar. Breeding occurs from May to June and clutches are three to five eggs. The nest is a strong cup of plant stems and soft twigs, lined with plant down fur and placed in fork of branch, commonly of tamarisk (Svensson 2006). The diet comprises mainly of invertebrates but also some fruit in the late summer. In Europe the species is migratory and winters mainly in the dry areas of Africa north of the equator (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;Widespread destruction of its habitat threatens this species in some areas. The clearance and burning of bushes, groves and hedges, and the drainage of of land for agricultural expansion has intensified. Pesticide use may also adversely affect populations. Factors in the wintering quarters including droughts and pesticide use may be responsible for the annual fluctuations of populations in Greece (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B362;Hippolais_polyglotta;This species is found in maquis, orchards, large and ill-kept gardens, oak (Quercus) scrub, dense thorny bushes in meadows, thickets in forest glades or at forest edges, overgrown pastureland and riverine forest. It breeds from March to July. The nest is a well-built cup of grasses, plant stems and soft twigs, often covered with pieces of bark and lichens, attached with cobwebs. It is lined with fine fibres, roots, fur and similar materials and placed in the fork of a branch in a tree. Clutches are four to five eggs. The diet is mainly insects and other invertebrates but it also takes some fruits and berries in the summer. The species is migratory, wintering in west Africa (Svensson and Christie 2013).;;This species is threatened by the effects of climate change, which  may reduce its range (Engler et al. 2013).
B348;Locustella_fluviatilis;During the breeding season this species is found in dense low vegetation, grass thickets, nettles (Urtica) and tangled herbage in meadows, moist woodland, damp forest clearings and sedge marshes. It is also uses riverbanks and abandoned cultivation. Egg laying begins from end of May and continues to mid-July in east Europe. The nest is a loose cup of grass stems and leaves, lined with finer grasses and hair. It is built in thick vegetation or at the base of a bush, on or very close to the ground and commonly has an approach “run” or corridor. Clutches are typically four to six eggs. It feeds mainly on insects but also takes spiders (Araneae), small ticks (Acarina), millipedes (Diplopoda) and small molluscs. The species is a long-distance migrant, wintering in eastern and southern Africa (Pearson 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B346;Locustella_lanceolata;This species inhabits damp valleys, especially by streams and on lake and marsh edges, open meadows with scattered bushes, damp woodland clearings and forest-edge scrub. It is also found in clearings in open birch (Betula) and larch (Larix) forest with patches of scrub and scattered bushes Pearson 2006). Egg-laying begins in mid-June and clutches are three to five eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a deep thick-walled cup of dry grass, leaves and moss, which is lined with finer grass. It is typically built in a shallow hollow beneath a grass clump and hidden by grasses and leaves. The diet is mainly adult and larval insects, especially beetles (Coleoptera) and ants (Hymenoptera) but it also takes spiders (Araneae) and seeds. The species is a long distance migrant, wintering in south-east Asia (Pearson 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species (Pearson 2006).
B349;Locustella_luscinioides;"This species inhabits marshes, fens, lake edges and reedbeds over shallow water. In Russia, it also occupies tall grass and bushes along riverbanks, and reedy canals within sparse forest. Generally it is found in lowlands up to c. 630 m in central Europe (Pearson 2006). Egg-laying begins from late April in western and central Europe and from mid-April in southern Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a deep cup, loosely built from dead water-plant leaves and grass stems and lined with finer leaves and plant fibres. It is well concealed less than 50 cm above water or swampy ground in aquatic vegetation. Clutches are two to six eggs. It feeds principally on insects but also takes spiders (Araneae) and small molluscs. The species is migratory; the whole population migrates to Africa (Pearson 2006).";;The species is well-known for short term population fluctuations. These probably result from habitat changes such as drainage and natural changes in water level as well as weather conditions in its African winter quarters (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species may also be vulnerable to future climate change (Maggini et al. 2014).
B347;Locustella_naevia;This species breeds at the edges of open woodland, in damp grazing land, in rank grasses, beds of nettle (Urtica) and brambles (Rubus fruticosus), scrubby sedge or reed marshes, at field edges and on upland moorland with willow (Salix) and birch (Betula) scrub. Egg-laying occurs from late April to mid-July in western Europe and clutches are typically five to six eggs. The nest is a thick cup of grass, stems and leaves built on a base of dried leaves and lined with finer material, such as feathers or hair. It is usually placed on or near the ground in thick vegetation, often in a grass tussock, bramble or sedge. The diet is mostly insects but spiders (Araneae) and some small molluscs are also taken. The species is a long distance migrant, passing through the Iberian Peninsula to winter in west Africa (Pearson 2006).;;This species suffers from changing land-use practices, such as the intensification of agriculture, leading to the destruction of grassland (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), wetland drainage and scrub clearance (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Pearson 2006). The species is also likely to be affected by future climate change (Huntley et al. 2008).
B367;Phylloscopus_bonelli;During the breeding season this species inhabits warm deciduous woodland comprising oak (Quercus), birch (Betula), beech (Fagus) and sweet chestnut (Castanea), together with a mixture of other deciduous trees as well as pine (Pinus), spruce (Picea) or larch (Larix), and with a good ground layer of vegetation. It is also common in cork oak (Quercus suber) and cedar woodland around the Mediterranean. In the west of its range it breeds in pine and oak scrub with undergrowth of bramble (Rubus fruticosus), barberry (Berberis) or juniper (Juniperus). Breeding occurs from the end of April to August.  The nest is a dome-shaped ball made mostly of grasses, with some leaves, moss and hair. It is well concealed on the ground, usually on a bank and beneath overhanging vegetation, fallen tree or branches. Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds on insects and other invertebrates. The species is migratory, wintering in a narrow belt along the southern edge of Sahara (Clement and Christie 2013).;;This species is likely to be negatively affected by intensive management and overexploitation of woodlands (Correia et al. 2014).
B370;Phylloscopus_borealis;During the breeding season this species is found in thick undergrowth, such as dwarf willow (Salix) clumps in damp valleys and riverine thickets, and in forests, principally of birch (Betula), willow, poplar (Populus) and pine (Pinus) forests with occasional spruce (Picea). At higher altitudes, it is also found in rhododendron (Rhododendron) thickets and in montane scrub above the tree-line. In Siberian taiga it frequently uses Alnaster fruticosus thickets. Breeding occurs from June to August. The nest is made mostly of grass stalks, bits of reeds, moss, plant fibres and horsetail (Equisetum) shoots and is placed on the ground in vegetation among tree roots, grass or reed clumps, tussocks or hummocks. Clutches are five or six eggs. It feeds mostly on small insects and other invertebrates. The species is migratory and winters in south-east Asia (Clement 2006).;;The species is threatened by future climate change (Heikkinen 2006).
B365;Phylloscopus_collybita;The species occupies lowland deciduous forest and woodland with low undergrowth, as well as parks, hedgerows, shelterbelts, overgrown cemeteries, large gardens and reedbeds. In the east of its it is found in a range in spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus) forests of Siberian taiga. Frequently, it inhabits damp alder (Alnus) and willow (Salix) woodland and river valleys and in the south of its range it prefers habitats with at least some tall trees but, exceptionally, breeds in coastal scrub lacking tall trees. It breeds from April to early August and lays five to six eggs. The nest is a ball of dry grasses, leaves, moss, plant fibres and feathers, normally placed on the ground and well concealed in a bramble bush (Rubus fruticosus), a patch of nettles (Urtica), grass or other thick vegetation. The diet is mostly insects and their eggs and larvae but also includes other arthropods, small molluscs (Gastropoda), seeds and berries (Clement 2006). Most populations of the species are migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;Fluctuations in the British population are believed to be likely due to droughts in the non-breeding quarters in the west African Sahel (Clement 2006). In Finland, the species suffers from habitat fragmentation, interspecific competition from Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) and Goldcrest (Regulus regulus) and climate change (Lampila et al. 2009).
B369;Phylloscopus_inornatus;This species breeds in a variety of broadleaf woodlands, including birch (Betula), willow (Salix) and poplar (Populus) groves and the edges of conifer forests, particularly in silver fir (Abies). In the south of its range it is found in mixed birch and larch (Larix), spruce (Picea), stunted cedar (Cedrus), juniper (Juniperus) and rhododendrons (Rhododendron), alders (Alnus) and other shrubs. After breeding it may occur in dwarf birch and stunted bushes above the tree-line. It breeds in June and July and lays two to four eggs. The nest consists of dry grasses, pine needles, moss, strips of rotting wood, fine plant fibres and animal hair and is placed on the ground under the roots of a tree, a fallen branch, against a decaying tree stump or under a bush. It feeds mainly on small invertebrates but may also take some small seeds. The species is migratory, wintering in south-east Asia (Clement 2006).;;"The size of the European population does make it vulnerable to the risks faced by small populations; however it is marginal to a much larger population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B368;Phylloscopus_sibillatrix;This species breeds in lowlands, in moist and shady deciduous woods, typically beech (Fagus), mixed oak (Quercus), hornbeam (Carpinus) and sweet chestnut (Castanea), with closed canopy and sparse undergrowth. It is also found in mixed stands of spruce (Picea), alder (Alnus), birch (Betula), pine (Pinus) or occasionally ash (Fraxinus).The optimal breeding areas are mixed stands with trees of mixed ages spaced well apart. It breeds from May to July and normally lays five to seven eggs. The female chooses the nest site and builds the nest which is a ball of dry grasses, leaves, plant stems and fibres, bark strips and animal hair. It is usually built on the ground but occasionally found under a fallen tree or roots (Clement 2006). The diet is mainly insects and other invertebrates, with some fruit taken in the autumn. The species is migratory and winters in sub-Saharan Africa (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In some areas changing forestry management practices have caused declines in this species (Mallord et al. 2012).
B366;Phylloscopus_sindianus;During the breeding season it occupies pine (Pinus) and birch (Betula) forests, willow (Salix) swamps, reedbeds, poplar (Populus) groves, and alders (Alnus) along streams, as well as gardens, orchards, sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), Myricaria elegans bushes and Caucasian rhododendron (Rhododendron) thickets, and on hillsides covered with juniper (Juniperus) in semi-arid mountain and in patches of dwarf birch along tree-line. Breeding occurs from May to early August and clutches are two to five eggs. The nest is a ball of coarse grass stems and dry leaves, plant fibres, animal hair and feathers, well concealed on ground, or up to four metres above it in low thorn-scrub or bush. The diet is poorly known but includes small insects and spiders (Araneae) and probably some small berries in autumn. The species is migratory (Clement 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B371;Phylloscopus_trochiloides;This species breeds in lowland and montane mixed birch (Betula) and conifer forests, also in broadleaf woods of beech (Fagus), maple (Acer) and lime (Tilia) interspersed with birch and pine (Pinus). It is also found in parks, gardens, riverine thickets and swamp-woodland with willows (Salix) and poplars (Populus). The breeding season is from May to mid-August (Clement 2006). The nest is a large, domed structure with a side entrance and is made from grasses, plant fibres, moss, rootlets and leaves and is lined with finer material such as hair, fur, down and feathers. It is sited on the ground in tall vegetation or low scrub, under stones, windfall or tree roots and sometimes in a crevice in a bank, old wall or tree stump. Clutches are three to seven eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). The diet is mostly small invertebrates but also takes fruits of elder (Sambucus) and some seeds. The species is migratory (Clement 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B364;Phylloscopus_trochilus;During the breeding season this species inhabits deciduous and mixed forests in which birch (Betula) largely predominates, but also birches and willow (Salix) thickets and scrub on arctic tundra. In central areas it is found in temperate heathland, forest clearings, damp areas with alders (Alnus) and willows as well as secondary growth, scrub and shrubby areas away from trees. It generally uses a wide selection of locations, including large overgrown gardens, orchards, hedges, railway embankments, and rough pastures with tussock grassland. It breeds from April to July and lays four to eight eggs. The nest is a ball of dry grasses, leaves, plant fibres, moss, strips of bark, animal hair and feathers and is placed on the ground, usually well concealed in vegetation. It feeds mainly on insects and their eggs and larvae and some plant material. The species is migratory and winters in Africa, south of the Sahara (Clement 2006).;;The species is affected by drought conditions in its wintering quarters and habitat alterations due to human population expansion (Thingstad et al. 2014). In the southern U.K., habitat loss linked to modern forest management techniques that alter the woodland vegetation structure is likely to have caused declines (Stostad and Menéndez 2014). In addition, declining oak tree health may have impacted the species as oak is typically a major source of invertebrates (Peach et al. 1995).
B372;Sylvia_atricapilla;"This species breeds in almost any kind of forested area. It prefers broadleaf deciduous forest and mixed woodland, either mature or more open and with denser understorey. In addition it occupies riparian forest, parks and gardens with trees, fruit-tree plantations, orchards, and evergreen woodland. In the winter , it uses more with bushy areas rich in berries and other fruits, such as maquis and garrigue, olive groves and urban gardens. 

Breeding mainly occurs from mid-April to August and it lays two to seven eggs. The nest is a finely structured cup with rather thin walls and bottom, made of grasses and herbs and some twigs and rootlets and lined with finer grass, hair and roots. It is normally built low in broadleaf deciduous vegetation, especially in dense foliage of a shrub or bush or the branches of a small tree but also in tall herbaceous vegetation. The diet consists chiefly of insects in the breeding season and mainly fruit the rest of the year. On Atlantic and Mediterranean islands the species is sedentary, in the Mediterranean Basin and in parts of western Europe it is partially migratory and it is a long-distance migrant in northern and eastern parts of its range (Aymíet al. 2013).";;In England, browsing deer (Cervidae) in young woodland can adversely alter habitat quality for understorey-dependent species such as this warbler (Holt et al. 2013). The species is trapped in some parts of its range.
B373;Sylvia_borin;"During the breeding season it inhabits dense bushes, woodland fringes and riparian forest with abundant undergrowth. It favours shady zones with herbaceous vegetation and broadleaf scrub and also often bushes close to reedbeds. In the Alps it occurs in stands of green alder (Alnus viridis) and birch (Betula) and various willows (Salix). In central Europe it prefers the presence of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), and in Finland is associated with raspberry (Rubus idaeus). In Britain it is abundant in areas of sessile oak (Quercus petraea).

Breeding occurs from April to July. The nest is a cup constructed from plant material such as grass, leaves and roots and lined with fine grass and hairs. It is usually placed low down, hidden in tree or bush or among tall plants. Clutches are four or five eggs. The diet is mostly insects throughout the year, especially during the breeding season, when some fruits and plant material are also taken. Through the rest of the year it is mostly frugivorous. The species is a long-distance migrant (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).";;The spread of exotic Reynoutria spp. has been shown to reduce numbers of this species where it occurs (Hajzlerová and Reif 2014).
B379;Sylvia_cantillans;This species prefers tall and dense heterogeneous maquis with sparse tree cover in dry Mediterranean areas, particularly maquis of holm oak (Quercus ilex) and those dominated by strawberry tree (Arbutus) and tree-heath (Erica). It is also frequently found in young cork oak (Quercus suber) forest and in dense but treeless bushy areas. It uses bushy formations dominated by brambles (Rubus fruticosus) along sunny ravines and valley bottoms and prefers the intermediate stages of post-wildfire succession. Breeding occurs from late March to late June and the species is monogamous. The male constructs several ‘cock nests’ but the both sexes build the breeding nest which is a deep, robust cup of grasses, thin roots and leaves and lined with finer grasses, rootlets and hair. It is placed in low scrub, bush or a small tree, c. 30–130 cm above the ground. Clutches are three to five eggs. The diet is mostly small insects and their larvae but outside of the breeding season berries and fruits are also taken. The species is a long distance migrant, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Aymí et al. 2013).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B374;Sylvia_communis;This species occupies open country in wide variety of landscapes, mostly sunlit areas with scattered bushes and shrubs close to grassy patches. It breeds in plantation clearings, orchards, hedgerows along roads or railway lines, shrubs near watercourses, pastures with junipers (Juniperus) and in steppes. It is also found in hedges around field crops, especially those of appropriate height such as cereals or lucerne (Medicago). It breeds mostly from April to July and generally lays four to five eggs. The nest is a fairly deep cup constructed from grass, leaves, rootlets, spider cocoons and hair and is concealed low down in a bush or tall grass (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). During the breeding season it feeds mainly on insects but in the late summer the proportion of fruit taken increases and in autumn and winter it feeds primarily on berries (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory and winters in sub-Saharan Africa (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).;;In the past, central and western populations have declined due to drought in the Sahel zone of west Africa from 1968–1975. In Europe, suitable breeding habitat has been lost to changes in land use through the intensification of agriculture, combined with the destruction of hedgerows and bushes (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). The species is also sensitive to severe winters, such as that of 1968-1969 (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B383;Sylvia_conspicillata;"This species is often found in very low scrubland in mostly dry warm Mediterranean areas and it favours the lowest and sparser scrubby areas characteristic of less developed garrigue, saltflats and semi-desert. It inhabits the first stages of post-wildfire succession, and can recolonize habitat one year after a fire. On Atlantic islands, race orbitalis occupies wider range of habitats, from scrub to cultivated or semi-cultivated areas. It breeds from February to June across most of its range; however race orbitalis breeds in most months except for June and July. The male sometimes builds “cock nests” but both sexes build the breeding nest, which is a deep cup loosely built from grasses, stems and leaves and lined with soft plant down, thin roots and some hair. It is sited in low scrub or bush, usually from ground level to c.60 cm. Clutches are three to five eggs. The diet is mostly small arthropods and insect larvae and eggs but also takes berries and occasionally nectar, mostly outside the breeding season. The species is resident and migratory; race orbitalis is mostly sedentary, most south-west European populations are migratory and those from Malta, southern Sicily, Cyprus and parts of Levant and southeast Spain are partially migratory (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).";;Local declines are thought to be due to urbanization, the conversion of steppes into irrigated lands, and afforestation. Those populations that are resident are also sensitive to severe cold winter weather (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).
B375;Sylvia_curruca;This species breeds in open country or near forests in a wide range of habitats rich in dense cover and lower-level foliage, such as shrubland, hedgerows and plantations with small trees. It is also found in gardens, parks, cemeteries, orchards, young conifer plantations and forest edges. Breeding occurs from late April to early August and normally three to seven eggs are laid. The nest is a deep cup of grass made of rootlets and small twigs, moss and spider webs and cocoons and usually lined with hair. It is placed in a thorny bush or shrub, or in small tree and occasionally in herbal vegetation. The diet is made up of mostly insects in the breeding season and fruits at other times of the year, although it is generally considered less frugivorous than many congeners. The species is a long-distance migrant (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).;;The intensification of modern agricultural techniques has driven habitat loss and declines in this species in western Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B377;Sylvia_hortensis;"This species is found in various types of open or semi-open woodland with variable bushy cover, such as maquis with cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Quercus ilex), dehesa-like forest of Argania spinosa, olive groves and park-like pine (Pinus) forest. It is also found in abandoned orchards, suburban gardens, and forested margins of vineyards and ravines. In southern Europe, breeding occurs from mid-April to July. It is monogamous and both sexes build the nest which is a rather robust cup of grass and plant material with vegetable down, moss and cobwebs, lined with finer grasses and fibres. It is placed c. 0·5–3·5 m above the ground in a bush or tree; frequently close to nest of Woodchat Shrike (Lanius senator). Clutches are typically three to five eggs. The diet is mainly arthropods, especially insects and their larvae but it also takes berries outside the breeding season. The species is a medium-distance to long-distance migrant (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).";;Habitat loss and deterioration of its woodland habitat have been caused mainly by agricultural intensification and decreased grazing. Wildfires can have adverse effect in the short term but may be beneficial by helping to open up forested areas (Tucker and Heath 1994, Aymí and Gargallo 2006). The species is also likely to suffer negative impacts from climate change (Doswald et al. 2009).
B380;Sylvia_melanocephala;As probably one of the most generalist of the Mediterranean warblers, this species is present in all types of warm habitat at low altitudes, and up to c. 1200–1300 m. It is found in maquis, garrigue, dry coastal habitats, urban and suburban environments, abandoned farmland and dry coast sites. It will also inhabit Mediterranean cultures such as olives, almonds, orchards, citrus groves, vineyards, but favours mosaic landscapes with hedgerows, bushes and stands of pine. It is also frequently found in holm oak (Quercus ilex) forests. Breeding occurs mainly from March to June. The nest is a grass cup placed usually 30–60 cm above ground in scrub or bush or, less frequently, among dense herbs or in a small tree. Most nests in Spain are in kermes oak (Quercus coccifera) at low height. Clutches are three to five eggs. It feeds mostly on arthropods but also takes a significant amount of fruit in the autumn and winter. Island and coastal populations appear to be mostly sedentary but the proportion of migrants increases inland and to the north, especially in the east (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).;;Particularly in the north of its range, extremely harsh winters can affect the survival of this species, in some cases with declines in breeding numbers of up to 50%. While it is thought global climatic warming could benefit this species in Europe, there is evidence it has caused decline in body mass and body conditions outside of Europe (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).
B381;Sylvia_melanothorax;"This species breeds in rather wide range of scrub and maquis, favouring medium-height maquis, such as that formed by Cistus, Pistacia lentiscus, juniper (Juniperus) and cypress (Cupressus); It is also found in more sparse and lower scrubby vegetation, as well as openings in woodland, bushy areas with sparse tree cover, and open pine (Pinus) woodland with considerable amount of undergrowth. It will use rocky hillsides and agricultural areas, so long as there is enough bush cover present. Breeding occurs from late March to June. The nest is a strong cup of grass and stems bound with cobwebs, lined with finer grass, cobwebs and hair and often with juniper bark in the outer wall. Normally it is placed c. 30–120 cm above the ground, inside a low bush. Clutches are typically four to five eggs. It is thought to feed mainly on invertebrates but the diet is poorly known and it may take berries outside the breeding season. The species is a partial migrant, with most birds migrating to north-east Africa (Aymí et al. 2014).";;The species is threatened by the abandonment of traditional grazing practices, the intensification of agriculture, homogenization of farmland and coastal and urban development (Ieronymidou et al. 2012). In addition the over use of pesticides could also be a potential threat. It is also subject to pressure from liming, netting and shooting (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B382;Sylvia_mystacea;During the breeding season this species occupies arid or semi-arid areas dominated by scrub and bush. It prefers treeless scrub covering valley bottoms and dry mountain slopes, and bushy tamarisk (Tamarix) formations along riverbanks. It is also found in scrub in sparsely wooded areas, and in more anthropogenic landscapes such as palm groves, gardens and orchards. The breeding season is from early April to July and the species is monogamous. Both sexes build the nest, which is a deep cup made of twigs, stems and grasses and lined with down and hair. It is usually sited in low grass, scrub, small bushes or young trees, from ground level to c. 70–90 cm. Normally four to six eggs are laid.  It feeds mainly on small arthropods, especially insects and their larvae and eggs but outside the breeding season it also takes various berries and fruits (mostly autumn) and seeds (winter) (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). The species is migratory, wintering in north-east Africa, Arabia and southern Iran (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B376;Sylvia_nisoria;This is a forest species but can occur in open woodland with variety of structured vegetation: woodland margins, dense thorny bushes, clearings with rich undergrowth, isolated tree stands, young plantations, riverine thickets, hedgerows at railsides and roadsides, pastures, meadows, parks and orchards. Breeding occurs from May to July. The nest is an open elaborate cup-shaped structure coated externally with spider webs and the silk of caterpillar cocoons. It is usually hidden in dense thorny bush such as Rubus, rose (Rosa) or hawthorn (Crataegus), occasionally in juniper (Juniperus), c. 30–200 cm above ground. Clutches are three to six eggs. The diet is mainly made up of insects during the breeding season but fruits become steadily more important once breeding has finished and just before and during migration. The species is migratory, wintering in east Africa (Aymí et al. 2015).;;In eastern Germany, the intensification of agriculture, ploughing of grassland and disappearance of large areas of low-intensity pastures and unproductive grassland have driven habitat loss. Fluctuations of populations and range may have climatic causes, as the species does not tolerate damp, cool, early-summer weather.  The disappearance of Lanius collurio may have also caused declines through the interdependence of both species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B378;Sylvia_ruppeli;This species breeds in dry and warm rocky areas and hillsides covered with scrub and maquis. It is found in a broad spectrum of dry Mediterranean habitats, from forested areas with sufficient undergrowth to maquis with sparse tree cover, such as open bushy woods of oak (Quercus) and cypress (Cupressus) and grassy and rocky terrain with rather dense to sparse scrub cover. In Greece, egg-laying is from mid-April to mid-May and clutches are usually four or five eggs (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). The nest is a strong cup of grass leaves and stems and some vegetable down, lined with finer materials and sited in thick, often thorny scrub, 45–75 cm above ground (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is thought to feed on adult and larval insects, although it is likely other arthropods are also taken and it also consumes berries outside the breeding season. The species is a long distance migrant (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).;;This species may be threatened by the future effects of climate change (Doswald et al. 2009).
B385;Sylvia_sarda;This species occupies uniform, low Mediterranean scrubland, such as Cistus garrigue and low to medium-height maquis of tree-heath (Erica arborea), strawberry-tree (Arbutus unedo) and Pistacia lentiscus. It is also found in more sparse scrubby grassland and degraded garrigue, as well as in areas of the very first stages of wildfire succession. Breeding occurs mostly from March to July and the species is monogamous. The male constructs several “cock nests” but both sexes build the breeding nest, which is a strong deep cup with a broadened rim, made from grasses, stems and leaves and lined with finer grass, hair and roots. It is normally placed in low bush or dense scrub, 60–140 cm above ground. Clutches are three to five eggs. It feeds mainly on spiders (Araneae) and small insects and their larvae. The species is mostly resident (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).;;There are not thought to be any current significant threats to this species.
B384;Sylvia_undata;It favours dense, homogeneous scrub, garrigue and low maquis c. 0.5–1.5 m in height and dominated by species such as Ulex, Erica, Rosmarinus, Genista, Cistus and Quercus coccifera. It is primarily a lowland species in the north of its range but occurs to 1,800–2,000 m in the Pyrenees. It breeds mostly from mid-March to August with time of egg-laying getting later further north. It usually has two broods, however in England it sometimes has up to three (rarely four) and is apparently single-brooded in Sardinia and parts of southern France. Male builds flimsy “cock nests”, one of which sometimes completed by female for breeding, but generally breeding nest constructed by both sexes. The nest is a deep cup of grass, vegetable down and cobwebs, lined with finer rootlets and hair, placed c. 0·25–0·5 m above ground in low dense scrub or bush. Clutches are three to six eggs, normally four or five. It feeds mostly on arthropods, which are the sole food fed to nestlings. Fruits taken in late summer and winter include those of genera Rubus, Daphne, Myrtus, Rhamnus, Myoporum, Pistacia, Vaccinium, Phyllirea and Phytolacca. It is largely sedentary but undertakes some short-distance dispersive movements and some European birds spend the non-breeding season in north-west Africa (Aymí and Gargallo 2006).;;Reasons for the recent Spanish decline are still unclear. It is vulnerable to severe winters, particularly in the northern part of its range (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). Cold spells in December 2001 and the winter of 2004-2005 caused high mortality in Spain (J. J. R. Encalado in litt. 2007), while the U.K. population was reduced to 11 pairs after the severe winter of 1962-1963 (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). Increasing densities of cattle on the Spanish dehesa are causing severe habitat degradation through overgrazing (J. J. R. Encalado in litt. 2007), which may be affecting the species. Afforestation has decreased the amount of suitable habitat in parts of France and Iberia (Shirihai et al. 2001). Changes in the pattern and frequency of wildfires may be a threat, although the species often colonises early successional habitat created by such fires (Aymí and Gargallo 2006). Post-fire forest management can negatively affect the species through the removal of burnt trees as the species has been shown to favour a moderate coverage of logging remnants after fires (Herrando et al. 2009).
B412;Panurus_biarmicus;This species is found in extensive reedbeds (Phragmites) and is associated with dense non-woody vegetation in and beside fresh and brackish water, or immediately adjoining marshes and swamps. It also uses the tussocky edges of reedbeds, stands of reeds and bulrushes (Typha) in marshes and shores of lakes and rivers. In the western Palearctic it breeds from late March to early September. Both sexes build the nest which is a deep cup-shaped structure of dead reed blades and other marsh-plant leaves, lined with flowering reed-heads and often also feathers and occasionally mammal hair. It is nearly always roofed by sheltering vegetation and is sited amongst close-growing and typically more or less vertical stems of reeds, sedges and other marsh vegetation. Clutches are most commonly four to eight eggs. The diet is mostly invertebrates and their larvae in the summer and vegetable matter in the late autumn and winter. Populations in Europe are mainly fairly sedentary, but are subject to eruptive post-breeding and wintering movements (Robson 2007).;;Populations have always been subject to regular annual population fluctuations. However in some areas such as Turkey, the breeding population is thought to be decreasing owing to the drainage of marshland habitat (Robson 2007). Declines have also been reported in the Netherlands as a result of habitat loss (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), which may also occur due to reedcutting (Burton and Burton 2002). The species is also noted for its sensitivity to severe cold winters (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997) and it has been exploited by the cage-bird trade in the past (Burton and Burton 2002).
B327;Troglodytes_troglodytes;"This species inhabits a wide variety of habitats. In western Europe, it is most commonly found in deciduous and mixed woodland, well-vegetated suburbs, urban parks and gardens, moorland scrub, and offshore islands with very scanty cover. In European Russia, egg-laying occurs from the second half of May; however in western Europe it begins late March or early April and a week or more later in central Europe. The nest is a domed structure with a side entrance hole (Kroodsma et al. 2013) and is made of grass, leaves, moss and other vegetation, lined with feathers and hair (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is sited in a wide range of locations, often in dense vegetation but also in a cavity or crevice and will use artificial sites. Clutches can be three to nine eggs but most often five to eight. The diet is mostly invertebrates such as spiders (Araneae), beetles (Coleoptera), earwigs (Dermaptera) and orthopterans but it will also take small vertebrates, such as small fish, tadpoles and young frogs. The species is resident, migratory and partially migratory (Kroodsma et al. 2013).";;"Some island populations, which represent whole subspecies are very small and thus vulnerable; the designation of race hirtensis, on St Kilda (Scotland) in 1884 led to an increase in collecting activity, although there is no evidence this caused a significant decline. In non-migratory populations, severe winters with prolonged snow cover can decimate numbers but this is normally temporary and recovery is quick (Kroodsma et al. 2013)."
B340;Turdus_iliacus;During the breeding season this species is found in forest-open country mosaics in lowlands and relatively low hills, with preference for mid-successional conditions, especially in river basins and on floodplains. It also inhabits open deciduous or mixed forest margins with fields and mires, clearings in primary forest, regenerating managed forest at the tall bushy stage with considerable understorey, shoreline thickets, tundra willow (Salix) and birch (Betula) scrub, scrubby semi-open cultivated sites, parks and gardens and thinned woodland with grassy areas around buildings. In the winter it uses open woodland, orchards and scrub thickets, wherever berry-bearing bushes and grassy areas are near by. The breeding season is from early April to late July, with some latitudinal variation. The nest is a bulky cup of grass, moss and twigs, bound with mud and bits of vegetation and lined with fine grass stems and leaves. It is sited on the ground in thick vegetation or low in a bush or tree or on a rotten stump. Clutches are normally four to six eggs. It feeds on invertebrates as well as seeds and berries in the autumn and winter. The species is chiefly migratory (Collar and de Juana 2013).;;Population numbers can be very variable owing to the effects of harsh and mild winters, and of unfavourably cold summers (Collar and de Juana 2013). The species is also illegally trapped in the Mediterranean (Murgui 2014).
B337;Turdus_merula;This species inhabits a very wide range of habitats. Its main and original habitat is relatively open broadleaf, coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests but it is also found in tree plantations, orchards, farmland, gardens and parks and commonly in open grassy areas so long as vegetation cover is within a short distance. In Europe it breeds from mid-March to early September. The nest is a large cup of dry grass stems and small twigs, packed with mud and lined with fine grass and stems. It is generally sited 0·5–15 m off the ground in a bush or tree or in a climbing plant against a wall, and frequently in or on a wall, outside or inside a building. It is a highly flexible and adaptive forager and feeds principally on invertebrates, mainly earthworms and insects and their larvae but will also take fruits and seeds and, occasionally, small vertebrates. The species is sedentary, partially migratory and fully migratory, depending mainly on latitude (Collar 2005).;;Declines in Britain may be owing to agricultural intensification, as decreases are greater on farmland. In the Cantabrian Mountains, in Spain, hunting may explain its scarcity there and in the Netherlands declines are possibly a result of lower breeding success. In the western Palearctic other threats include predators, disturbance, adverse weather conditions, nest collapse and starvation (Collar 2005).
B341;Turdus_philomelos;This species breeds in almost all types of temperate forest and woodland, generally in lowlands and valleys but reaching the tree-line in Switzerland and Russia. It requires patches of trees and bushes with small areas of open moist ground supporting abundant invertebrate fauna. It has also adapted well to modern lowland agricultural and urban landscapes, breeding in small woodlots, parkland, orchards, mature hedgerows, overgrown railway embankments, roadsides, cemeteries, and suburban gardens with some tall trees. In non-breeding areas in the south of its range habitats are somewhat drier. In western Europe breeding occurs mainly from mid-March to mid-August but can start a month later in central and northern Europe. The nest is a neat cup of grass, twigs and moss with a thick hard lining of clay, mud, dung or rotten wood, often mixed with leaves. It is usually placed in a bush, shrub or tree, often against the trunk, but can also be in a creeper on wall, in a bank or on a ledge. Clutches are three to five eggs (Collar 2005). It feeds on a wide range of invertebrates, especially earth worms, as well as fruit as it is available through the year (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, although southern and western populations are mostly sedentary (Collar 2005).;;Local declines are thought to be due to changes in agricultural practices which may have caused a major reduction in availability of key summer food resources on lowland farmland, as well as the loss of hedgerows, scrub and permanent grassland with livestock, and the wide-scale installation of under-field drainage systems, which causes early soil drying and thus a loss of topsoil earthworms. Pesticides and predators may also be a threat (Collar 2005). The species has been subject to hunting for many decades in the Mediterranean, but there is no clear evidence this has caused a decline (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar 2005). Adverse weather is also known to negatively affect this species (Robinson et al. 2004).
B339;Turdus_pilaris;This species typically inhabits mixed habitat, mainly part-wooded and part-open country, commonly using trees for breeding and roosting and hedges and open ground for foraging. It breeds in boreal forests of mixed pine (Pinus) and birch (Betula), as well as scrub, clearings, parks and gardens. In high latitudes, relatively small numbers extend beyond the tree-line into alpine heathland and tundra scrub, and even to entirely bleak grassy islands in the extreme north. It winters mainly in lowlands, often in more open habitats, including grassy and cultivated fields, moorland edges, woodland edges and orchards. Breeding occurs from early April to late August, with timing varying with latitude. The nest is a bulky, untidy cup, made of twigs, roots, moss, lichen, grass and leaves, lined with animal hair, rootlets and fine grass, and cemented with mud. It is generally sited in the fork of a tree or against the trunk or on a branch, usually towards upper levels of tree and normally at least two metres off the ground but occasionally on ground, or in a cliff face. Normally lays five or six eggs. The diet is mainly invertebrates and fruits, but also takes berries and seeds in the winter, and shoots and buds in the spring. The species is migratory but movements are essentially irruptive and nomadic (Collar 2005).;;In southern Greenland the species may have been extirpated by severe winters during the 1960s (Collar 2005).
B338;Turdus_ruficollis;This species is found in sparse montane forest, the upper limits of cedar (Cedrus) forest, mossy tree-lined scrub, plateau taiga, and bottomland forests in montane river valleys. In Russia, it breeds from May to July. The nest is placed low down, usually below two meters, in a rotten stump or in the sheltered fork of a tree, frequently in larch (Larix), poplar (Populus) or cedar shrub. It is a cup of twigs, moss and stems cemented with mud, and lined with finer stems. Clutches are four or five eggs. It feeds on invertebrates but also takes berries and seeds in the autumn and winter. The species is migratory (Collar 2005).;;"The size of the European population could render it susceptible to the risks affecting small populations; however it is adjacent to a much larger non-European population (Birdlife International 2004)."
B336;Turdus_torquatus;"This species is found in mountain steppe with conifers, including wet spruce (Picea) and spruce-fir woodland (P. abies-Abies alba). In central Europe it also uses conifer-beech (Fagus), extending into bushy scrub with Rhododendron hirsutum and Pinus mugo in alpine regions, dry rugged upland slopes, heath and heather moorland with bracken, stones and grass patches, subalpine meadows with scattered shrubs and trees and low shrubbery above the tree-line on rocky slopes. In Britain it favours heather-grass mosaics and Nardus-Molinia grassland  and most nesting territories contain small crags, gullies, scree and/or boulders, as well as sloping or flat areas with short vegetation and scattered trees or bushes.

Breeding occurs from mid-April to mid-July in Britain and the Alps and in Scandinavia from early May to the end of June in the south and late May to early August in the north (Collaret al. 2013). In Britain the nest is generally built on or close to the ground, however in Poland it is found mostly in trees close to the trunk (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a bulky cup of dry grass, stems, moss and leaves mixed with mud and lined with dry grass. Clutches can be from three to six eggs but most commonly four or five. It feeds on invertebrates, seeds and fruits, with invertebrates making up most of the diet in spring and early summer. The species is migratory; British and northern European breeders are thought to winter mainly in southern Spain and north-west Africa (Collar et al. 2013).";;Causes of declines are not clearly understood in this species. It is thought to be suffering from increased human disturbance and the development of many upland areas for outdoor leisure pursuits as well as from competition with species such as T. merula, T. viscivoru and T. pilaris. In southern Spain, the widespread loss of juniper forest may be partly responsible for decline in British breeding populations, where it may also be suffering from  large-scale afforestation in the uplands (Collar et al. 2013) and increased grazing intensity (Burfield 2002). Hunting of north-west European migrants passing through southern Europe may also be significant (Collar et al. 2013). The species may also be threatened by climate change (Beale et al. 2006).
B342;Turdus_viscivorus;"The species requires a mosaic of wooded and open country, and thus inhabits open mature forest, woodland glades, orchards, riverside forest, open grassland with scrub and mountain steppe with shrubs; often penetrating grassy-bracken moorland areas on low craggy hills and mountains at some distance from trees. It is most typically found, in rolling, open landscapes with scattered trees or copses, including parkland and park-like farmland.

In western and central Europe, it breeds from late March to late June and from late April in the north. The nest is a large cup of dry grass, plant stems, roots and moss, bound together with mud and lined with fine grasses and sometimes pine needles. Typically it is found two to ten metres up in the fork of a tree and normally lays three to five eggs. It feeds on invertebrates as well as seeds and fruit in the autumn and winter. In the west of its range the species is sedentary or a partial migrant and in the north and east of its range it is more fully migratory (Collar 2005).";;In Spain the species suffers pressure from hunting. Finnish populations have suffered from the felling of old growth forest (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar 2005) as a result of modern forestry practices. Studies in the Netherlands have shown fluctuations in population numbers due to severe winter weather (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B335;Zoothera_dauma;The European, race aurea breeds in dark coniferous and mixed forests of the southern boreal zone and dark taiga zone, typically in spruce (Picea) forests along river valleys, wooded steppe, mixed or broadleaf stands on ridges and slopes, open woodland with larch (Larix), birch (Betula) and aspen (Populus), often in headwater areas. Breeding is known to occur from late May to August in Siberia. The nest is a large cup of moss, twigs, grass and roots, with a rim of mud, twigs and moss as a basal fixative and lined with fine rootlets, fern stems and fibres. It is generally sited one to six metres up in a tree fork, bush or bank. The diet is made up of mainly invertebrates, including worms, insects and their larvae, small slugs and snails but it will also take berries (Collar 2005). The race aurea is wholly migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;In Europe, the species may have declined during the 20th century due to the intensification of forestry methods but current practices are more balanced (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B32;Ardea_alba;All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Palearctic populations are migratory (Flint et al. 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), sometimes with other species. Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species is a diurnal feeder (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments its feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown et al. 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (Snow and Perrins 1998). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey et al. 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown et al. 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1–15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than one metre apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).;;The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) for example through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). The species previously suffered from intense persecution for the plume trade (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).
B30;Ardea_cinerea;Most Palearctic populations of this species are fully migratory, dispersing widely in September and October after the breeding season and returning to breeding grounds in February (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). This species is a generalist in its habitat use, although shallow water, relatively large prey, and four or five months of ice-free breeding season are among the essential characteristics of its habitat (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to 500 or even 1,000 m, occasionally breeding much higher (Snow and Perrins 1998) (2,000 m in Armenia), inhabits any kind of shallow water, either fresh, brackish or saline, both standing or flowing, and shows a preference for areas with trees as it is commonly an arboreal rooster and nester. Some degree of isolation and protection are also typical of places chosen for roosting and nesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is found inland on broad rivers, narrow streams, lake shores, ornamental ponds, fish-ponds, marshes, flood-plains, reeds swamps, rice-fields and other irrigated areas (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), river oxbows, reservoirs, ditches, canals, sewage farms, inland deltas, and on islets and emerging rocks (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the coast the species also frequents deltas, salt-marshes (Brown et al. 1982, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), estuaries, tidal mudflats, muddy and sandy shores, and sand-spits (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists predominantly of fish and eels 10–25 cm long, as well as amphibians, crabs, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, snakes, small rodents, small birds (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and plant matter (although this may be incidental, or only to aid in pellet formation) (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The nest is a stick platform that is often re-used over successive years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually positioned high in a tall tree up to 50 m, but also on the ground or on cliff edges, in reedbeds or in bushes. In reed-beds nests may be built of reeds, and ground nests may be reduced to a slight scrape, ringed with small stones and debris (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species commonly nests in colonies and nesting sites are typically situated 2–38 km (convenient flying distance) from preferred feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).;;"In Europe the species was heavily persecuted in the nineteenth century due to its consumption of fish, which resulted in competition with fishermen and fish farmers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Although killing at aquaculture farms has not reduced the global population so far (possibly because it is young birds that are mostly killed) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), 800 herons are estimated to have died per year at Scottish fish-farms between 1984 and 1987 (Carss 1994, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) by being shot, drowned or poisoned by fish farmers (Carss 1994). Renewed hunting poses a threat to Bavarian populations by decreasing numbers to levels that inhibit recovery following severe winters (severe winters increase mortality rates for juveniles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Timber harvesting is a threat throughout much of the species range by removing trees used by nesting colonies and/or disturbing nearby colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases."
B31;Ardea_purpurea;Populations breeding in the western Palearctic are migratory (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and travel on a broad front between breeding and wintering grounds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds from April to June in the western Palearctic. It is a colonial breeder (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014, Turner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and although nesting group sizes are usually small and rarely exceed 50 pairs (Turner 2000), colonies of up to 1,000 pairs have been recorded in some areas (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It often also nests on the periphery of colonies of other heron species such as Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In migratory populations the autumn migration occurs from August to October (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), with the return passage in the spring beginning in March (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). The species is mainly crepuscular, but may also feed diurnally. The species inhabits wetlands from sea level to 1,800 m (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), showing a preference for dense, flooded, freshwater reedbeds (Phragmites spp.) in temperate areas (occupying Typha, Scirpus and Papyrus swamps elsewhere) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It also utilises lake shores, river margins (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), ditches, canals, brackish water lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields and coastal mudflats (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Its diet consists of fish 5–15 cm long (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (occasionally up to 55 cm), salamanders (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), frogs, insects (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. beetles, dragonflies, hemiptera (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and locusts (Hancock and Kushlan 1984)), crustaceans (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), spiders (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and molluscs (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) as well as small birds and mammals, snakes and lizards (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is a platform of reeds stems or sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) positioned over or beside water up to three metres high in flooded reedbeds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), three to four metres high in thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or up to 25 m high in trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species usually nests in loose single- or mixed-species colonies with A. cinerea, and although colony sizes are usually small, large groups of up to 1,000 pairs have been recorded (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).;;The main threat to this species in Europe is the loss of reedbeds though direct elimination (to reduce sedimentation) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), agricultural encroachment (Hockey et al. 2005), water management practices (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. drainage) (Hockey et al. 2005) and reed cane harvesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).
B34;Ardeola_ralloides;In the Palearctic this species is migratory and dispersive (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), travelling on a broad front between breeding and wintering areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds from April to July in Eurasia in single- or mixed-species colonies that can be up to 2,000 pairs in size. After breeding Palearctic populations migrate south from August to November (Kushlan and Hancock 2005. Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), returning to the breeding colonies between February and May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species feeds solitarily (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or in small groups of 2–5 individuals during the breeding season (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) although in winter and on migration large feeding flocks may form (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is mainly crepuscular (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), roosting by day and night in large (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) often mixed-species (Brown et al. 1982) groups in sheltered woods and reedbeds (these roosts may draw in herons feeding up to 80 km away) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species inhabits permanent or temporary wetlands (Brown et al. 1982) showing a preference for fresh waters with abundant marsh vegetation (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), reedbeds, nearby bushes, trees and scrub (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Habitats frequented include swampy plains, river valleys, deltas, lakes, ponds, canals, ditches and rice paddyfields (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). On migration (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) the species may also occur on estuaries, inshore reefs or islets (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).  and usually breeds in the lowlands although it has bred on montane lakes up to 2,000 m. Its diet consists predominantly of larval insects although fish and amphibians (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. frogs and tadpoles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) up to 10 cm long, grasshoppers, beetles, butterflies, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs and exceptionally small birds may also be taken. The nest is a well-constructed platform usually placed less than two metres (occasionally up to 20 m) high near or over water in reedbeds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) or in dense thickets of trees or shrubs (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. of willow (Salix spp.) or poplar (Populus spp.)) (Hafner and Didner 1997), preferring nesting sites within five kilometres of feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds in single- or mixed-species colonies that can be up to 2,000 pairs in size (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), neighbouring pairs building nests 5–10 m apart (occasionally as close as 0.5 m) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).;It generally avoids dry habitats and those with very high rainfall (Kushlan and Hancock 2005),;The greatest threat to this species is the loss and deterioration of natural and man-made freshwater habitats (e.g. through changes to flood regimes in rice paddyfields) and wet woodlands (e.g. through woodcutting and burning) (Hafner and Didner 1997).
B38;Botaurus_stellaris;Populations breeding on the Atlantic coast of Europe and in the Mediterranean are largely sedentary due to the relatively mild winters (Newbery et al. 1996) (although they may make local dispersive movements related to rainfall) (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). Continental populations are mainly migratory however (Newbery et al. 1996, Kushan and Hancock 2005) with a marked post-breeding dispersal of immatures (Kushan and Hancock 2005). The species breeds from March to June in Eurasia. The species has highly restrictive breeding habitat requirements (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015). It shows a strong preference for quiet lowland marshes around lakes and rivers (less than 200 m Asl) (Kushan and Hancock 2005) with extensive dense young reedbeds of Phragmites spp. (e.g. with one to three years worth of new growth (Marion et al. 2000, Puglisi et al. 2005) but still maintaining some old or dead stems) that are flooded but are fairly shallow (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) (less than 30 cm deep) (Newbery et al. 1996), have few fluctuations in water-level (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), have low acidity (Kushan and Hancock 2005) and are surrounded by clear open areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) of deeper water, which is maintained into the driest part of the breeding season (Gilbert et al. 2005). Breeding adults are more attracted to unfragmented (Puglisi et al. 2005) reedbeds over 20 ha in area, although smaller sites with networks of reed-fringed waterways or open wetland habitats with a number of small reedbeds (Newbery et al. 1996) (greater than 100 m) (Gilbert et al. 2005) over a wide area may also be used (Newbery et al. 1996). The species frequents a more varied range of habitats outside of breeding season, foraging on rice-fields, watercress beds, gravel pits, fish farms, ditches, sewage farms (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), small ponds and wet grassy areas (Kushan and Hancock 2005) as well as marshes and reedbeds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015). It also forages in running water when still waterbodies freeze during the winter (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). Its diet varies depending on the site and season although it predominantly takes fish (particularly cyprinids and eels) and amphibians as well as adult and larval insects, spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, snakes, lizards, birds, nestlings and small mammals (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015). The nest is a pad of reeds and other vegetation (Kushan and Hancock 2005) constructed close to or floating on water (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) amidst dense reedbeds (Kushan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015).;;The species is threatened mainly by the loss of Phragmites reed marshes (Kushan and Hancock 2005) owing to habitat alteration through drainage (Kushan and Hancock 2005), direct destruction (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), changes in traditional management (e.g. changes to reed harvesting regimes) (Marion et al. 2000), sea level rise and salt water intrusion (Newbery et al. 1996), the effects of wave action from boat traffic at the edge of open water (Marion et al. 2000), and pollution (Marion et al. 2000, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015) (either eutrophication which modifies fish populations within reedbeds or pesticides which may reduce the species's survival) (Marion et al. 2000). Disturbance from humans during the nesting period is also a threat (Newbery et al. 1996, Marion et al. 2000, Kushan and Hancock 2005) (e.g. disturbance from reed cutting (Kushan and Hancock 2005), noisy recreation and water-sports (Newbery et al. 1996, Marion et al. 2000, Kushan and Hancock 2005), motor vehicles and hunting (Kushan and Hancock 2005)). The hunting of adults and collecting of eggs and chicks still occurs in some areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2015), and the species may suffer high mortalities in very cold winters (especially in sedentary populations) (Marion et al. 2000).
B35;Bubulcus_ibis;Most populations of this species are partially migratory, making long-distance dispersive movements related to food resources in connection with seasonal rainfall (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown et al. 1982, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), feeding in loose flocks of 10–20 individuals (Brown et al. 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species is a diurnal feeder (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey. The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), dry arable fields (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), artificial grassland sites (e.g., lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).It occurs from sea-level up to c. 1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown et al. 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter may also be taken (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), marshes, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998).; It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). ;Large colonies nesting in urban areas are perceived as a public nuisance and may be persecuted (e.g. by disturbance to prevent colony establishment, removal or direct killing) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In its breeding range the species is threatened by wetland degradation and destruction such as lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002), and in some parts of its range it is susceptible to pesticide poisoning (organophosphates and carbamates) (Kwon et al. 2004).
B33;Egretta_garzetta;All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Populations breeding in the Palearctic are highly migratory (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). The timing of breeding varies geographically (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) although, in general, European populations breed in spring and summer (March to July). The species usually nests in colonies sometimes of thousands of pairs and often with other species. Some populations also breed solitarily or in small single-species groups of under 100 pairs. It inhabits fresh, brackish or saline wetlands (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and shows a preference for shallow waters (10–15 cm deep) in open, unvegetated sites where water levels and dissolved oxygen levels fluctuate daily, tidally or seasonally, and where fish are concentrated in pools or at the water's surface (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Habitats frequented include the margins of shallow lakes, rivers, streams and pools, open swamps and marshes, flooded meadows, flood-plains (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), lagoons, irrigation canals, aquaculture ponds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), saltpans (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and rice fields (which are especially important in areas with few remaining natural wetland habitats) (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species also occupies dry fields and cattle pastures (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and some populations are almost entirely coastal, inhabiting rocky or sandy shores, reefs, estuaries, mudflats, saltmarshes and tidal creeks (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 20140). It is a highly opportunistic feeder (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), taking mainly small fish under 20 g in weight and less than 10 cm long (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), aquatic and terrestrial insects (e.g. beetles, dragonfly larvae and crickets) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and crustaceans as well as amphibians, molluscs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (snails and bivalves) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, worms, reptiles and small birds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species may nest on the ground in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or up to 20 m high on rocks, in reedbeds, bushes or trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It usually nests in single- or mixed-species colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It may feed up to 7–13 km away from breeding colonies during the breeding season (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).;;The species is threatened by wetland degradation and loss through drainage for agriculture, changes in current management practices and contamination from agricultural and industrial operations (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Ellis et al. 2004, Melville and Shortridge 2006), and it previously suffered from hunting for the plume trade (although this is no longer a threat) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014).
B37;Ixobrychus_minutus;Palearctic populations of this species undergo extensive post-breeding dispersal movements in all directions and are also fully migratory, travelling southward on a broad front (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) between August and October and returning to the north from March to April (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In the western Palearctic the species breeds mainly between May and July. It breeds singly or occasionally in small loose groups in favourable areas (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The species is most common in freshwater marshes with beds of bulrushes (Typha spp.), reeds (Phragmites spp). (Hockey et al. 2005) or other dense aquatic vegetation, preferably also with deciduous bushes and trees (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) such as willow (Salix spp). or alder (Alnus spp.) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). It may also occupy the margins of lakes, pools and reservoirs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), wooded and marshy banks of streams and rivers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), peat bogs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), wooded swamps, wet grasslands, rice-fields (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), rank vegetation around sewage ponds (Hockey et al. 2005), and in places the margins of saline lagoons (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and saltmarshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Its diet varies with region and season but it is essentially insectivorous and takes aquatic adult and larval insects such as crickets, grasshoppers, caterpillars (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and beetles (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other food items include spiders, molluscs, crustaceans (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. shrimp and crayfish) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), fish, frogs, tadpoles, small reptiles and birds. The nest is constructed from reeds and twigs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and is normally placed near open pools in thick emergent vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) (such as beds of bulrushes Typha spp. or reeds (Phragmites spp.)) (Hockey et al. 2005) close to the surface of the water or up to 60 cm above it (Snow and Perrins 1998). Alternatively nests may be placed in low bushes or trees (e.g. alder or willow) up to two metres above water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Preferred nesting sites are usually 5–15 m out from the shore in water 20–30 cm deep (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;Since 1970, European populations have fallen, most likely due to habitat destruction and pollution, however these alone do not explain its decline. In Belgium, the species has suffered from pollution and the drainage of wetlands and in the Netherlands building construction has disturbed nesting habitat. High mortality during migration and in the wintering quarters has been attributed to the European declines. Droughts in Africa have led to desertification and loss of wetland areas, which extends the trans-Saharan crossing (Tucker and Heath 1994). Recreational activities such as fishing and swimming are also a threat as is the intensive commercial use of water areas (e.g. reed cutting, fish farming), river regulation measures and eutrophication (Bauer et al. 2006). The species may also be affected by fires (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2009).
B36;Nycticorax_nycticorax;Northern populations of this species are migratory, with those breeding in the western Palearctic travelling on a broad front across the Sahara (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Post-breeding southward movements occur from September to October and return northward movements occur from March to May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In temperate regions breeding occurs in the local spring (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in small numbers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single- or mixed-species colonies, although sometimes groups may reach several thousand pairs (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). When nesting within mixed-species colonies the species tends to form monospecific clusters (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species inhabits fresh, brackish or saline waters with aquatic vegetation and trees (e.g. pine, oak) for roosting and nesting in (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014), showing a preference for islands or predator-free areas for nesting sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occupies the forested margins of shallow rivers, streams, lagoons, pools, ponds, lakes and marshes and may feed on pastures, reservoirs, canals, aquaculture ponds (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and rice-fields (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On migration the species may also frequent dry grasslands or marine coasts (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and estuaries (Hockey et al. 2005). It is common at elevations of up to c. 2,000 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is an opportunistic feeder taking fish, frogs, tadpoles, turtles, snakes, lizards, adult and larval insects (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) (e.g. beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and dragonflies) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, leeches, small rodents, bats and the eggs and chicks of other bird species (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). The nest is a platform constructed of sticks and vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) placed 2–50 m above water or on dry ground near water (Snow and Perrins 1998) in trees, bushes, reedbeds, on cliff ledges and on the ground (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).;;The species is threatened by wetland drainage and destruction (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) and by drought in wintering areas (Hafner and Kushlan 2002). It is highly susceptible to pesticides (Kwon et al. 2004, Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014) such as organophosphates, carbamates (Kwon et al. 2004) and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) which negatively affect hatching success (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). There are also cases of genetic damage to chicks as a result of petroleum contamination (Custer 2000). The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Kuiken et al. 2006). It is also persecuted (anti-predation killing) at aquaculture facilities due to its depredation on fish stocks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and has suffered declines due to the exploitation of chicks from nesting colonies in the past (Martínez-Vilalta et al. 2014). Chicks of the species are still taken for food in some areas (Hafner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).
B29;Pelecanus_crispus;"This species occurs mainly on inland, freshwater wetlands but also at coastal lagoons, river deltas and estuaries (Peja et al. 1996, Crivelli et al. 1997, Mix and Bräunlich 2000, Elliot et al. 2014). Typically winters on ice-free lakes in Europe (Elliot et al. 2014). It starts to breed in late March and April (Elliot et al. 2014), sometimes solitarily but usually in dense colonies of up to 250 pairs ( Cramp et al. 1977, Elliot et al. 2014). Adults form monogamous pair bonds (Mix and Bräunlich 2000). It leaves the colonies between the end of July and September, although a few remain until November (Nelson 2005). It is gregarious during the winter, often occurring in large flocks and foraging communally and cooperatively in small groups (Cramp et al. 1977).  Immature birds and non-breeders may remain in the wintering grounds year round (Nelson 2005), or may stay with the breeding colonies (Cramp et al. 1977).

Birds return to the breeding sites in late-January to April, depending on the region (Nelson 2005). It breeds on small islands in freshwater lakes or in dense aquatic vegetation such as reedbeds (Crivelli 1994, Peja et al. 1996, Pyrovetsi 1997, Elliot et al. 2014), often in hilly terrain (Nelson 2005). A few breed in Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Peja et al. 1996, Nelson 2005). Nests typically consist of a pile of reeds, grass and sticks approximately 1 m high and 0.5–1.5 m in diameter (Nelson 2005, Elliot et al. 2014). They are usually situated amongst aquatic vegetation on floating or stationary islands isolated from the mainland to avoid mammalian predators (Crivelli 1994, Peja et al. 1996, Pyrovetsi 1997) but occasionally may be built on open ground (Hatzilacou 1993, Hatzilacou 1999, Nelson 2005). Artificial islands may also be used for nesting (Pyrovetsi 1997, S. Bugariu in litt. 2012). It feeds almost entirely on fish (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is dispersive in Europe, moving only short distances typically within the eastern Mediterranean (Elliott et al. 2014).";;Former declines were primarily caused by wetland drainage, shooting and persecution by fishers (Crivelli 1994, Crivelli et al. 1997, Mix and Bräunlich 2000). Cases of illegal shooting are still reported (e.g. four shootings in 2009 in the Danube Delta, B. Barov in litt. 2009). Other continuing threats include disturbance from tourists and fishers, wetland alteration and destruction, water pollution, collision with overhead power-lines and over-exploitation of fish stocks (Crivelli et al. 1999, Hatzilacou 1993, Mix and Bräunlich 2000). Organochloride residues including DDT have been recorded in high levels in the eggs of this species and those of its prey (Albanis et al. 1995). Nest predation by wild boar at times of low water levels is the most important threat to the Bulgarian breeding colony (N. Petkov in litt. 2007). The breeding colonies in Mediterranean lagoons in Albania and Turkey are threatened by coastal developments and the alteration of the functioning of the lagoons (Peja et al. 1996).
B28;Pelecanus_onocrotalus;Its regular habitat includes fresh or brackish water of lakes, deltas, lagoons and marshes, often requiring extensive reed beds for breeding.  Within Europe the populations are fully migratory (Elliott et al. 2014) and travel via important stop-over sites (Nelson 2005). The species is entirely piscivorous, and in Europe it prefers carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Elliott et al. 2014);;The species is threatened by habitat destruction through drainage (Crivelli et al. 1991, Johnsgard 1993, Nelson 2005, Elliott et al. 2014), the divergence of rivers for irrigation (Johnsgard 1993), agriculture development and industry (Elliott et al. 2014). It is also subject to climatic fluctuations that have a strong influence over water-levels in wetlands: floods leading to the inundation of nesting sites (Elliott et al. 2014) and lowering water-levels leading to the death of fish due to increased water salinity (Crivelli 1994). The species is threatened by persecution (Johnsgard 1993, Elliott et al. 2014) and hunting for sport because of its (minimal) depredation of fish from fish-farms (Crivelli et al. 1991, Kostadinova et al. 2007). It also suffers mortality due to collisions with electric powerlines during migration, dispersal or on its wintering grounds and is often found drowned in fishing nets (Crivelli et al. 1991). Disturbance (Elliott et al. 2014), (e.g., from tourism) threatens breeding colonies (Crivelli et al. 1991), and pesticides, heavy metal contamination and disease could have devastating effects on large colonies in the future (Crivelli et al. 1991, Elliott et al. 2014).
B42;Platalea_leucorodia;"Palearctic breeding populations are fully migratory (Matheu et al. 2014) but may only travel short distances (Snow and Perrins 1998). In the north of its range the species breeds in the local spring (e.g. from April). The species usually nests in monospecific colonies or in small monospecific groups amidst mixed-species colonies (Matheu et al. 2014). When not breeding the species forages singly or in small flocks (Matheu et al. 2014) of up to 100 individuals (Hancock et al. 1992) and migrates in flocks of up to 100 individuals (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is most active during the morning and evening (although in coastal areas it forages at low tide regardless of the time of day) (Hancock et al. 1992), and often roosts communally up to 15 km away from feeding areas (Brown et al. 1982). The species shows a preference for extensive shallow (Matheu et al. 2014) (less than 30 cm deep) wetlands with mud, clay or fine sand substrates. It inhabits either fresh, brackish or saline (Hancock et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) marshes, rivers, lakes and flooded areas, especially those with islands for nesting or dense emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) and scattered trees or shrubs (Matheu et al. 2014) (preferably willow (Salix spp.), oak (Quercus spp.) or poplar (Populus spp.)) (Hancock et al. 1992). It may also frequent sheltered marine habitats during the winter such as deltas, estuaries, tidal creeks and coastal lagoons (Hancock et al. 1992, Matheu et al. 2014). Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (such as waterbeetles, dragonflies, caddisflies, locusts and flies), molluscs, crustaceans, worms, leeches, frogs, tadpoles and small fish (Matheu et al. 2014) up to 10–15 cm long (Hancock et al. 1992). It may also take algae or small fragments of aquatic plants (Matheu et al. 2014) (although these are possibly ingested accidentally with animal matter) (Hancock et al. 1992).

The nest is a platform of sticks and vegetation constructed on the ground on islands in lakes and rivers, or alternatively in dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds) (Matheu et al. 2014), bushes or deciduous trees (such as willow, oak or poplar) (Hancock et al. 1992) up to five metres above the ground (Matheu et al. 2014). The species nests in colonies within which neighbouring nests are usually placed one or two metres apart or touching (Hancock et al. 1992). Breeding colonies are sited within 10–15 km of feeding areas, often much less (although the species may also feed up to 35–40 km away) (Hancock et al. 1992).";, generally avoiding waters with rocky substrates, thick vegetation or swift currents (Hancock et al. 1992);The species is threatened by habitat degradation through drainage and pollution (Matheu et al. 2014) (e.g. chlorinated hydrocarbons) (Hancock et al. 1992), and is especially affected by the disappearance of reed swamps due to agricultural and hydroelectric development (Hancock et al. 1992). Over-fishing and disturbance have caused population declines in Greece (Hancock et al. 1992), and human exploitation of eggs and nestlings for food has threatened the species in the past (Hancock et al. 1992, Matheu et al. 2014). Poaching and collisions with overhead electricity cables are the main non-natural causes of death during migration (Triplet et al. 2008). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B41;Plegadis_falcinellus;"All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersal movements (Matheu et al. 2014) and are considerably nomadic (Snow and Perrins 1998). In addition northern breeding populations are fully migratory (Matheu et al. 2014) and may travel on a broad front (e.g. across the Sahara) (Brown et al. 1982). Northern and southern breeding populations breed during the local spring, whilst breeding elsewhere coincides with the rains (Matheu et al. 2014). The species nests in mixed-species colonies, either in small groups (Brown et al. 1982) or in large aggregations of thousands of pairs, and during the winter or dry seasons the species usually forages in small flocks (Hancock et al. 1992, Matheu et al. 2014) of up to 30 individuals (Brown et al. 1982). It often roosts communally at night in large groups (sometimes thousands of individuals) with other species, occasionally in trees far from wetland feeding sites (Brown et al. 1982). The species feeds in very shallow water (Hancock et al. 1992) and nests in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes) and low trees or bushes (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Matheu et al. 2014). It shows a preference for marshes at the edges of lakes and rivers (Hancock et al. 1992), as well as lagoons, flood-plains, wet meadows (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Matheu et al. 2014), swamps (Matheu et al. 2014), reservoirs (Hancock et al. 1992), sewage ponds, rice-fields and irrigated cultivation (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Matheu et al. 2014). It less often occurs in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, saltmarshes (Hancock et al. 1992) and coastal lagoons (Matheu et al. 2014). Roosting sites are often large trees that may be far from water (Brown et al. 1982, Matheu et al. 2014). The diet of the species varies seasonally depending on what is available (Hancock et al. 1992). It takes adult and larval insects (e.g. aquatic beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and caddisflies), worms, leeches, molluscs (e.g. snails and mussels), crustaceans (e.g. crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish, frogs, tadpoles, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds (Matheu et al. 2014).

The nest is a platform of twigs and vegetation usually positioned less than one metre above water (occasionally up to seven metres) in tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes), low trees or bushes over water (Matheu et al. 2014).";;The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Snow and Perrins 1998, Matheu et al. 2014) through drainage (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hancock et al. 1992) for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002), clearing, grazing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It is also threatened locally by hunting (Snow and Perrins 1998, Matheu et al. 2014), disturbance and pesticides (Matheu et al. 2014), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B43;Phoenicopterus_roseus;"The species inhabits shallow (Snow and Perrins 1998) eutrophic waterbodies (Hockey et al. 2005) such as saline lagoons, saltpans and large saline or alkaline lakes (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 2014). It will also frequent sewage treatment pans, inland dams (Hockey et al. 2005), estuaries (Brown et al. 1982) and coastal waters (Diawara et al. 2007), seldom alighting on freshwater but commonly bathing and drinking from freshwater inlets entering alkaline or saline lakes (Brown et al. 1982). It nests and roosts on sandbanks, mudflats, islands (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 2014) or boggy, open shores (Flint et al. 1984). It breeds regularly from March to June in large dense single-species colonies of up to 20,000 pairs (occasionally up to 200,000 pairs).

The species nests in large dense colonies on mudflats or islands of large waterbodies, occasionally also on bare rocky islands (del Hoyoet al. 2014). The nest is usually an inverted cone of hardened mud (Flint et al. 1984) with a shallow depression on the top (alternatively it may be a small pile of stones and debris when mud is not available). Its diet consists of crustaceans, molluscs, annelid worms, larval aquatic insects, small fish, adult terrestrial insects, the seeds or stolons of marsh grasses, algae, diatoms and decaying leaves. It may also ingest mud in order to extract organic matter (e.g., bacteria) (del Hoyo et al. 2014). Juveniles, and to a lesser extent adults (Mateo et al. 1998), are prone to irregular nomadic or partially migratory movements throughout the species's range in response to water-level changes (Snow and Perrins 1998, Hockey et al. 2005).";;The species suffers from low reproductive success if exposed to disturbance at breeding colonies (Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986, Yosef 2000) (e.g., from tourists, low-flying aircraft (Ogilvie and Ogilvie 1986) and especially all-terrain vehicles (Yosef 2000)), or if water-levels surrounding nest-sites lower (resulting in increased access to and therefore predation from ground predators such as foxes and feral dogs) (Miltiadou 2005). The species also suffers mortality from lead poisoning (lead shot ingestion) (Mateo et al. 1998, Miltiadou 2005), collisions with fences and powerlines (Hockey et al. 2005), and from diseases such as tuberculosis, septicemia (Nasirwa 2000) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974).
B287;Dendrocopos_major;This species is found in trans-Palearctic coniferous and deciduous forests between the northern taiga and the Mediterranean (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is also common in copses, tree avenues, parks and gardens. Courtship begins in December and egg-laying from mid-April to June (later in the far north and at higher altitude). The species is monogamous and both sexes excavate a new hole each year, in a dead or living tree of a wide variety of species. Occasionally utility poles are used and nest boxes as well. Clutches can be four to eight eggs but normally five to seven. Its diet is varied and displays clear seasonal changes in more seasonal habitats. It feeds mainly on invertebrates but will also take crustaceans and mussels, coniferous seeds, nuts, acorns, buds, tree sap, berries, fruit and possibly nectar. It is also notorious for taking the eggs and young of other birds. It is mostly resident and dispersive although northern populations are also subject to eruptive migration (Winkler and Christie 2013).;;"Harsh winters can cause significant mortality in this species. Fragmentation of habitat is a threat locally. The Canary Island races canariensis and thanneri are currently probably the most vulnerable, especially the former, which may be at some risk because of human exploitation of Canarian pine forest (Winkler and Christie 2013).  Air pollution, causing die-back in forests, in central and eastern Europe appears to have mixed effects; where damage is heavy nesting possibilities, food supply and food quality deteriorate causing a decline in woodpeckers, although the impact of this is unknown. Hybridization is known to occur with Syrian Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos syriacus) (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997)."
B288;Dendrocopos_syriacus;"This species occurs in open country with wooded areas. It is often found in plantations of all kinds, including olive, pecan (Carya) and avocado in the south, and vineyards in central Europe, where it is also seen in roadside trees and groups of trees, mainly near habitations, as well as forest edges, parks and gardens. It inhabits oak (Quercus) woodland and light montane forest in the southeast and breeds in coniferous forest at lower levels in Turkey. Egg-laying occurs from mid-April to May, rarely to June. The nest-hole is excavated by both sexes, but mostly by male, in a trunk or large branch of a tree, or occasionally in a utility pole or similar structure. Old nests are sometimes reused. Clutch size is three to seven eggs (Winkler et al. 2014). It is omnivorous, feeding on various insects, snails, earthworms, fruit, berries, sap, nuts and seeds (Gorman 2014). The species is resident and dispersive; sometimes long distances are covered during dispersal (Winkler et al. 2014).";;Hybridization is known to occur with Great Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), however once sufficient females of D. syriacus colonize an area, the extent of hybridization becomes insignificant (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B284;Dendrocopos_minor;"The species is present in temperate and boreal deciduous woodland in lowlands. It prefers open forest with softwood deciduous trees in vicinity of lakes or rivers, as well as forest edge, parks, orchards and gardens. It requires a good number of thin snags, as in old stands or in riparian woodland. Courtship begins in February and laying takes place from April to May (June in the north). Clutches are usually five or six eggs. It is monogamous and the pair-bond may continue for several years. The nest is excavated by both sexes, in soft wood of a dead or decaying trunk, a stump or the underside of a branch. Its diet comprises mainly of small insects; in the summer mostly caterpillars, aphids, ants, beetles, and other surface-dwelling arthropods and in the winter, wood-boring larvae and those living under the bark become important (Winkler and Christie 2002). The species is essentially sedentary but dispersal movements in August and November may give rise to eruptive movements in the north (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;This species has declined due to a loss of deciduous habitats, especially riverine forest and old orchards and due to the admixture of conifers (Winkler and Christie 2002). It is sensitive to forest fragmentation due to its large home range (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).
B290;Dryocopus_martius;"The species is found in all types of mature forest, so long as it is not extremely dense and gloomy and it also uses forest edges. In Scandinavia and Siberia it occupies spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus) forests with larch (Larix), birch (Betula), aspen (Populus) and alder (Alnus); In Poland all habitat types in primeval forests; in central Europe occurs in all types of not over-dense deciduous, mixed or coniferous forest, from riparian woodland to subalpine forest. Mating behaviour may begin in mid-January although egg-laying is generally from mid-March to mid-May. The nest is excavated in a tall tree, usually living and either coniferous or deciduous. Clutch size is typically three to five eggs. Its diet consists mainly of ants (Camponotus, Formica, Lasius) and their brood. Wood-boring beetles and bark beetles and their larvae (e.g. Cerambycidae, Elateridae) are also taken, as well as various other arthropods, and occasionally snails, fruits and berries. It has been reported to break into beehives. In most areas the species is resident and even northern populations only partially migratory (Winkler and Christie 2002).";;The species is not threatened across its range (Winkler and Christie 2002), however locally logging and forestry management do pose a risk (Garmendia et al. 2006, Zhelezov 2010).
B283;Jynx_torquilla;This species is widespread over most of lowland Europe, and also occurs in low numbers in mountainous areas. Breeding occurs in a variety of forest-types, from dry pine (Pinus) stands to riparian forest.  the birds tending to settle along south-facing forest edges, or in clear-felled or burned patches. Where summers are relatively cold or humid, localities with dry sandy soil are preferred (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is territorial and partners display by head-swinging with ruffled head feathers. Laying occurs from May to June. The nest-site is selected by both sexes and is usually in a natural cavity, an old hole of another woodpecker, or an artificial nestbox. Typically seven to twelve eggs are laid (Winkler and Christie 2002). It feeds mostly on the larvae and pupae of ants. In northern areas or during bad weather insects, spiders, even tadpoles and berries may be fed to young (Tucker and Heath 1994). Across most of its range, it is fully migratory and winters mainly in south of the Sahara and occasionally in the Mediterranean basin (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;Dense forest blocks are avoided,;Declines have been attributed to climatic changes, resulting in increased rainfall during the breeding season (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Winkler and Christie 2002). Since the 1950s, the loss of important habitats such as orchards and unimproved meadows and the replacement of hardwoods with conifers have also caused declines and the conversion of many areas to agriculture combined with an increase in the use of pesticides have also decreased the abundance of ants (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B285;Dendrocopos_medius;The species is restricted to mature deciduous forest. It prefers mixed oak (Quercus), on which it depends on in large parts of its range, and hornbeam (Carpinus) in primeval forest.  Old open orchards bordering deciduous woodland also used, but are of dwindling importance. In the south it occupies beech, mixed oak-beech and oak forest and beech forest in north-east Anatolia and the Caucasus. Breeding begins from mid-April to the beginning of May. The nest is excavated by both the male and female in the trunk or a larger branch of a deciduous tree, mainly in dead or decaying wood. Clutch size is typically five to six eggs. It feeds mainly on bark-dwelling arthropods, caterpillars, dipterans and aphids. Small beetles and ants predominate in the adult food, whereas nestlings are fed with caterpillars, bugs, lice, beetles, hymenopterans and dipterans, as well as arachnids. Plant material is taken mainly in the winter (Winkler et al. 2014). The species is non-migratory (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Declines in the species have mostly been driven by forest management , especially fragmentation of oak forests, elimination of old and decaying trees and the replacement of indigenous deciduous forest with coniferous. The effects of atmospheric pollution may pose a risk (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Climatic changes and adverse weather also influence populations on a local scale (Winkler et al. 2014).
B289;Picoides_tridactylus;The species inhabits mature conifer forests, particularly spruce Picea spp., and is somewhat irruptive, being found commonly where disturbance such as fire has caused local outbreaks of insects (Winkler et al. 1995). Courtship begins from the second half of March and laying from mid-May, although it can be up to two weeks earlier in southern Europe, to June, occasionally July. The nest-hole is excavated two to ten metres up in a dead tree, or in a dead section of live tree with heart-rot. Spruce and other conifers are preferred but some non-coniferous species (Populus, Betula, Alnus) are also used (Winkler and Christie 2002). Clutch size is generally three or four eggs in the Alps. It feeds primarily on engraver and spruce bark-beetles (Ips and Polygraphus spp.) as well as wood-boring beetles and other invertebrates (Gorman 2014). In the mountains populations are largely resident, but often shift to lower altitudes or move short distances after breeding. Northern Eurasian populations perform eruptive migrations at long intervals (Winkler and Christie 2002).;;Large-scale commercial logging and modern forestry management practices, including fire suppression, removal of dead or insect-infested trees (Tucker and Heath 1994) and pesticide use (Winkler and Christie 2002) have led to declines. Wide spread death of spruce and fir, stands caused by acid rain in central Europe, may temporarily benefit the species, but may pose a serious threat in the long term (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B292;Picus_canus;This species occupies a wide range of habitats. It uses open country with many copses, in not over-dense forest, floodplain-forest, parks, orchards and gardens. It is associated mostly with deciduous trees, but locally in pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) woodland, or more open coniferous montane forest with larch (Larix). In Europe it is found in lowlands and hills up to 1,700 m and non-breeders up to 2,000 m. It lays from the end of April to early June and clutches are four to ten eggs. The nest-hole is excavated in dead wood or soft living wood, or in fungus-afflicted hard wood and most often in deciduous trees of variety of species. Its diet is chiefly ants (Myrmica, Lasius), termites (Isoptera) and their brood, which often make up more than 90% of stomach contents but it also feeds on other insects and spiders as well as the nest contents of other birds, fruits, berries, seeds, nuts, acorns and nectar. The species is non-migratory although some local post-breeding movements occur (Winkler and Christie 2015).;;The large-scale clearance of old deciduous woodland and conversion to coniferous plantations, resulting in habitat loss and isolation is a major threat. Changes in forestry practice are shortening the rotation period, resulting in the loss of potential nesting trees and a marked reduction in the time-span available for nesting. High levels of nutrient input from agriculture are thought to reduce habitat suitability for ants and thus driving declines in the species main food supply. Orchards are also being lost through the expansion of villages. The extent and quality of riverine forests is also decreasing through flood-prevention schemes, canalization and damming (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B291;Picus_viridis;This species uses a great variety of semi-open habitats. It is confined to larger open sections or clearings in extensively wooded areas, forest edges, copses, parks, orchards and residential areas, usually near mature deciduous trees, but often associated with conifers in mountains and in the north. Laying occurs from early April to June and clutches are usually five to eight eggs. The nest is excavated in dead or soft, living wood in unbroken trees. It feeds predominantly on ants with larger ant species generally preferred. Other insects are also taken, as are earthworms and snails and occasionally reptiles, fruits, berries and seeds. The species is resident, although some local winter movements occur (Winkler and Christie 2015).;;The main threats to this species are the intensification of agriculture and forestry, and the conversion of pasture to arable land, which considerably reduces ant populations (Winkler and Christie 2015). Intensive forestry has also resulted in the loss of nest-sites (Tucker and Heath 1994). Harsh winter weather can also cause major mortality, effects of which may last for years (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Winkler and Christie 2015) and can be exacerbated by the impacts from other threats (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B8;Podiceps_auritus;This species breeds on small, shallow fresh (Llimona et al. 2014), brackish or slightly alkaline (Fjeldsa 2004) waters between 0.5 and 2 m deep and between 1 and 20 ha in area (Snow and Perrins 1998) with rich floating (Konter 2001), submergent and emergent vegetation (Fjeldsa 2004). Habitats include small pools, marshes with patches of open water and secluded sections of larger lakes and rivers (Llimona et al. 2014). In its wintering range the species frequents coastal inshore waters (Llimona et al. 2014) up to 10?20 m in depth (Fjeldsa 2004) including sheltered bays (Llimona et al. 2014), lagoons and estuaries (Ogilvie and Rose 2003). It may also occur on large lake and river systems south of its breeding range (Llimona et al. 2014, Fjeldsa 2004). The species breeds from April to August, generally in solitary isolated pairs. The nest is a platform of aquatic vegetation either floating and anchored to emergent vegetation, built from the lake bottom (where water is shallow) or built on rocks at water level. Clutch size can be between one to eight eggs but normally four to five in Europe. Its diet consists predominantly of fish and invertebrates such as adult and larval insects, crustaceans (Llimona et al. 2014), crayfish (Fjeldsa 2004) and crabs (Konter 2001), molluscs and worms. Fish and crustaceans are more important components of the diet during the winter when the species is at sea (Llimona et al. 2014). This species is fully migratory (Llimona et al. 2014) and travels over land in stages on a broad front, some populations only moving short distances to the nearest ice-free coast (Fjeldsa 2004).;;The main threats to the species are human disturbance, forestry operations around breeding lakes (e.g. afforestation leading to hydrological changes and resulting in reduced numbers of invertebrate prey), fluctuating water levels, and the stocking of lakes with rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) (which competes with the species for aquatic insects) (Llimona et al. 2014). Historical range contractions have also occurred due to acidification and increased humus content of lakes, and the species is vulnerable to hypertrophication (Fjeldsa 2004). It is commonly caught and accidentally drowned in fishing nets (Llimona et al. 2014) and is particularly vulnerable to oil spills in the marine environment during the winter (Llimona et al. 2014, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Fjeldsa 2004).
B6;Podiceps_cristatus;The species breeds on fresh or brackish waters with abundant emergent and submerged vegetation, showing a preference for non-acidic eutrophic waterbodies with flat or sloping banks and muddy or sandy substrates (Snow and Perrins 1998) and large areas of open water. Suitable habitats include small pools or lakes, backwaters of slow-flowing rivers and artificial waterbodies (Llimona et al. 2014). The species overwinters on large exposed ice-free (Fjeldsa 2004) lakes and reservoirs, moving to sheltered coastal inshore waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) less than 10 m deep (Fjeldsa 2004) such as brackish estuaries, deltas, tidal channels and tidal lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998) during cold spells (Fjeldsa 2004). In Europe, it breeds between April and September. The nest is a platform of aquatic plant matter either floating on water and anchored to emergent vegetation or built from the lake bottom in shallow water (Llimona et al. 2014). Typical nest sites include reedbeds or flooded thickets as well as more open sites such as floating mats of water-weed or kelp fronds (Fjeldsa 2004). Normally three to five eggs are laid. Its diet consists predominantly of large fish as well as insects, crustaceans (e.g. crayfish, shrimps) and molluscs, occasionally also adult and larval amphibians. The species's invertebrate consumption is highest during the breeding season. The majority of this species is fully migratory although some populations may only undergo local dispersive movements (Llimona et al. 2014).;;The species suffered declines in the nineteenth century as a result of hunting for the plume trade (this is no longer a threat). Amelioration of climate has actually helped this species expand in some areas (Llimona et al. 2014). The species is commonly drowned accidentally in monofilament gill-nets (fishing nets) (Fjeldsa 2004, Llimona et al. 2014). It may also be threatened by future coastal oil spills (Gorski et al. 1977), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).
B7;Podiceps_grisegena;"The species breeds on small, shallow inland waters with abundant emergent vegetation and stretches of open water, showing a preference for waters in forested areas or in shrub tundra further to the north. Suitable habitats include small pools and lakes, backwaters of large rivers, pools cut off from the sea in estuaries (Llimona et al. 2014) and coastal lagoons. In coastal locations the species often makes foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas, and if foraging at sea it shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). When moulting, on passage or during the winter the species frequents large inland lakes or shallow coastal areas (Fjeldsa 2004) with abundant fish stocks (Llimona et al. 2014), often considerable distances from the shore, amongst islands in archipelagos or over drop-off zones (Fjeldsa 2004).

The bird breeds from April or May to June or August. The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation. Clutches are normally three or four eggs (Llimona et al. 2014). Its diet consists predominantly of invertebrates (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as adult and larval aquatic insects, crayfish and molluscs (Konter 2001), although fish are also important locally or seasonally. This species is fully migratory (Llimona et al. 2014).";;The species is threatened by the modification and degradation of lakes and by human disturbance from water-based recreational activities. It may also be threatened by future oil spills at sea during the winter (although during this season the species is widely scattered along coasts, so the effects of oil spills are likely to be small) (Llimona et al. 2014). The species is also at risk from gillnet fisheries, wind turbines and the reduction of bottom habitats by dredging and coastal development (HELCOM 2012).
B9;Podiceps_nigricollis;"During the breeding season this species frequents permanent and temporary (Snow and Perrins 1998) small, shallow, highly eutrophic pools with lush vegetation, such as freshwater marshes and lakes (Llimona et al. 2015) with dispersed submergent vegetation and patches of reeds (Konter 2001, Fjeldsa 2004), as well as ponds and fish ponds, sewage farms, quiet river backwaters and newly flooded areas (Llimona et al. 2015). In southern Russia it shows a preference for variably developed reed swamps and gypsotrophic lakes (alkaline waters with rich submergent vegetation such as Chara and Potamogeton pectinatus) (Fjeldsa 2004). Outside of the breeding season the species moves to salt lakes (Llimona et al. 2015), hyper-saline industrial evaporation ponds (Fjeldsa 2004) and reservoirs, or to coastal estuaries, arms of the sea, and inshore shallows in bays and channels (Snow and Perrins 1998).

The breeding season runs from April to August with peak egg-laying in May and June (Llimona et al. 2015). It usually nests colonially in thinly spaced, emergent marsh vegetation (such as Scirpus, Typha or sedge Carex), or on dense mats of floating waterweed, sometimes far from the shore (Fjeldsa 2004). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic vegetation anchored to emergent vegetation. It usually lays three or four eggs (Llimona et al. 2015). The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of adult and larval insects, molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians (Llimona et al. 2015), midges and brine-flies, nereid worms, small fish (Fjeldsa 2004) and snails (Konter 2001). This species is fully migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998), although the extent of migration varies between populations and some populations remain predominantly sedentary, such as in Spain (Llimona et al. 2015).";;The species is vulnerable to oil pollution as it frequently winters on the coast (Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Llimona et al. 2015), and is susceptible to avian cholera (Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Friend 2006), Erysipelas (Jensen and Cotter 1976, Friend 2006) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974) so is threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they afterwards rebound (Jehl et al. 2002). Local declines of this species are also attributed to human disturbance (especially recreational activities on lakes) (Llimona et al. 2015), and it is commonly killed by collisions with power transmission lines (Malcolm 1982). The species is predated by American Mink (Neovison vison) in the Slonsk Reserve, western Poland (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003).
B5;Tachybaptus_ruficollis;"The species inhabits a wide range of small and shallow wetlands (Llimona et al. 2014) usually less than 1 m deep (Fjeldsa 2004) with rich vegetation (floating, submerged and emergent) and high densities of aquatic invertebrates. Suitable habitats include small lakes, ponds, the sheltered bays and vegetated shores  of larger freshwater and reservoirs, canals (Llimona et al. 2014), slow-flowing rivers (Konter 2001), flood-plain oxbows, coastal brackish lagoons, alkaline or saline lakes, rice-fields (Brown et al. 1982), seasonally inundated areas, swamps, sewage lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004) and gravel pits (Santoul and Mastrorillo 2004). Outside of the breeding season it is common on more open waters and is occasionally observed along the coast in estuaries or sheltered bays protected from strong wave action (Llimona et al. 2014) and when moulting the species requires rich feeding areas (Fjeldsa 2004).

The timing of breeding varies geographically and depends on the growth of emergent vegetation and water-levels (Llimona et al. 2014). In Europe, egg-laying begins in late February (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic plant matter (Llimona et al. 2014) anchored to emergent vegetation (Fjeldsa 2004), submerged branches or bushes close to the edge of shallow wetlands (Brown et al. 1982). Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects, especially mayflies, stoneflies, water bugs, beetles, flies, caddisflies and dragonflies, as well as molluscs, crustaceans, adult and juvenile amphibians and occasionally small fish (up to 11 cm) (Llimona et al. 2014) during the winter (Konter 2001). This species is sedentary, locally dispersive or fully migratory depending on the winter temperatures of its breeding grounds (Llimona et al. 2014).";, generally avoiding waters with large predatory fish (Konter 2001);The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of this virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). In Europe numbers often fluctuate, mainly as a result of winter conditions, such as the marked decline in Britain after the cold winter of 1962–1963, and similarly in the Netherlands after that of 1984–1985. The species suffers from the transformation of wetlands by destruction, pollution or recreational use but this is often offset by construction of man-made ponds, reservoirs and dams, leading to expansion of species in many areas (Llimona et al. 2014).
B22;Oceanodroma_castro;"The species breeds on undisturbed islets, in flat areas near the sea or inland on cliffs (Carboneras et al. 2014). Marine and highly pelagic, it occurs in warm temperate waters and rarely approaches land except near colonies. The species feeds mostly on planktonic crustaceans, small fish and squid; also feeds on some human refuse and scraps scattered by predators. Off the Azores its main diet includes lanternfish, small crustacea and squid. Feeds mainly on the wing, by pattering and dipping; also surface seizes. Most feed by day, and occur alone and in small aggregations in the Atlantic Ocean (Carboneras et al. 2014).";;"The species is directly exploited by local fishermen, particularly on some North East Atlantic islands. It is also susceptible to predation by introduced mammals, (e.g. rats, cats, mice and mongoose; Caral et al. 2005, Bried et al. 2009) and from native gull species such as Larus cachinnans. Habitat degradation and destruction in its breeding colonies is considered an issue (ICN 2006).  It is affected by light pollution at sea, and mortality might be significant around the Canary Islands (Rodriguez and Rodriguez 2009, Carboneras et al. 2014)."
B21;Oceanodroma_leucorhoa;This species is marine and pelagic, often occurring in areas of convergence or upwelling or over continental shelves, rarely coming near land except at colonies. Its diet comprises mainly of small fish, squid, planktonic crustaceans and offal which is catches on the wing by dipping, skimming or snatching from the surface. It sometimes follows marine mammals feeding on left overs or faeces. Its breeding season is variable depending on locality, forming colonies on offshore islands on high ground or slopes, usually among rocks but also in soft soil between trees (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;"Species suffers severe predation, chiefly by native species including gulls (e.g. Herring (Larus argentatus), Great Black-backed (L. marinus) and Lesser Black-backed Gulls (L. fuscus)), Great Skuas (Catharacta skua), as well as from introduced mammalian predators; rats (Rattus spp.), cats (Felis catus), mice (Mus musculus), mink, otters and foxes; these are responsible for some local declines, and some colonies having moved to predator-free offshore stacks (Carboneras et al. 2014). It may be vulnerable to collisions with wind farms, although the current risk to the population is assessed as low (Bradbury et al. 2014)."
B20;Hydrobates_pelagicus;This is a marine species feeding mainly on small fish, squid and crustaceans, but it will also feed on medusae and offal. It feeds mainly on the wing by pattering and fishing, and will occasionally follow ships and attend trawlers. Breeding starts in May and June, resulting in the formation of colonies on rocky ground on offshore islands and stacks that are largely free of mammalian predators (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;The accidental introduction of predators, such as rats and cats to breeding colonies is a major threat to this species, particularly in southern Europe and the Mediterranean (Cadiou et al. 2012, Carboneras et al. 2014). In some areas, increases in numbers of skuas and large gulls appear to have increased the rate of predation. Reduction of prey, caused by unsustainable fisheries may also impact this species (Madroño et al. 2005). There may be some risk from eating contaminated food items or taking indigestible matter but, by feeding in flight, the species is less vulnerable to oil spills than some other seabirds (Tucker and Heath 1994, Newbury et al. 1998). Coastal development, particularly in the Mediterranean region has caused habitat destruction and disturbance (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including shifts in prey availability, and storms and extreme weather events. Light pollution from ships and coastal developments may also create a problem at night for this species (Jiménez et al. 2009, Sultana et al. 2011). In Molène archipelago, France, population has declined over last two decades due to continuous nest-site destruction (Carboneras et al. 2014).
B19;Pelagodroma_marina;The species uses marine and pelagic habitats (Carboneras et al. 2014). It comes ashore only to breed (Jouanin and Roux 1965, Jensen 1981). On the Selvagens (Portugal) egg-laying is reported mid-March to early June, with the clutch a single egg (Carboneras et al. 2014). Birds excavate long burrows in sandy soil usually among thick vegetation which conceals the entrance hole (Snow and Perrins 1998). The breeding grounds on the Selvagens have a good covering of vegetation, mostly of ice-plants (Mesembryanthemum cristallinum), the roots of which stabilize the very sandy soil (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is present on breeding islands from March to September and may disperse to areas off the east coast of North America (Carboneras et al. 2014). It feeds mainly on planktonic crustaceans (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;In general this species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and locally subject to exploitation by fishermen. It is also affected by predators such as mice (Mus musculus), rats (Rattus spp.), cats (Felis catus), owls, skuas (Catharacta), large gulls (Larus spp.) and snakes (Carboneras et al. 2014). Other threats include: habitat degradation and problems caused by rabbits, disturbance from other birds, attraction to light at night (Madroño et al. 2004).
B13;Bulweria_bulwerii;This species is marine and highly pelagic, usually being found far from land except during the breeding season. Nests can be burrows, crevices, cracks or caves, under debris or vegetation cover. Its diet comprises mainly of fish and squid, with minor proportions of crustaceans and sea-striders, feeding largely at night by surface-seizing (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;Predation by cats, rats and endemic invertebrates occurs at breeding colonies in the North East Atlantic (Cabral et al. 2005, Matoas et al 2009). A large colony in Desertas Island (Madeira) suffers intense human exploitation for food or fish bait, which also occurs in other North East Atlantic sites although not in Salvage Island (Madeira), since the declaration of the island as a national park (Carboneras et al. 2014). Light pollution at night might be important cause of mortality in some areas. Habitat loss at colony sites is also considered a threat to this species in the Canary Islands, Madeira and Azores (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species is vulnerable to oil spills and marine pollution. It is at risk of being caught as bycatch in fishing gear including pelagic longlines (Waugh et al. 2012).
B14;Calonectris_diomedea;"The species is marine and pelagic usually keeping well away from land, except at colonies (Carboneras et al. 2014). It breeds on barren offshore islands, occupying cliffs, caves and boulder fields; sometimes inland on rocky slopes, up to 435 m above sea-level (Thibault et al. 1997). Birds return to colonies in February and breeding starts April (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is colonial, nesting in burrows (c. 2 m long) (Fernandez 1995) rock crevices, natural hollows or cracks, sometimes in caves up to c. 20 m deep (Carboneras et al. 2014). Clutch size a single egg (Thibault et al. 1997). It feeds mainly on fish, squid, crustaceans, other zooplankton and offal at least during the breeding season (Brooke 2004). The species is migratory, generally departing the breeding grounds in mid to late October (Carboneras et al. 2014). It is known to winter mainly in the Canary Current (Navarro et al. 2009). Mediterranean birds exit into the Atlantic, where they move rapidly south, but also uncommon to rare off eastern North America (mainly May-October) (Howell 2012), and some birds occasionally range northwards in the north-east Atlantic, to British Isles (Fisher & Flood 2004, 2010) and Sweden (Erterius 2005), with other accidental records from Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland and Ukraine (Thibault et al. 1997). It was previously thought to occur off South Africa in November-May but recent work found that Calonectris borealis is far more abundant over the continental shelf and in offshore areas than C. diomedea (Camphuysen & van der Meer 2001) and the two species appear well-segregated during northern winter (Navarro et al. 2009).";;"The main threats to this species include the impacts of invasive, non-native mammals and mortality from fisheries bycatch (Derhé 2012, Carboneras et al. 2013). Recent studies have highlighted the pressures imposed by introduced mammal species, and colonies have shown marked increases in breeding success during mammal control measures (e.g. Igual et al. 2006, Pascal et al. 2008). This species is one of the most frequent seabird species to occur in bycatch in the Mediterranean (Valeiras and Caminas 2003, García-Barcelona et al. 2010, Laneri et al. 2010), with estimates of the number of individuals killed annually by Spanish fleets ranging from 200 (García-Barcelona et al. 2010) to 467-1,867 (estimated 4-6% of the local breeding population; Belda and Sanchez 2001). There have been fewer assessments of the impacts of long-line and other national fisheries on this species. Results from a questionnaire suggest an annual bycatch of up to 1,220 individuals of this species by Maltese fleets (8.5-10% of the breeding population), although this is likely to be an over-estimate skewed by high bycatch in a small number of vessels (Dimech et al. unpubl. per Derhé 2012). The species may also suffer significant bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro et al. 2006)."
B10;Fulmarus_glacialis;"The species spends large amounts of time in waters over continental shelf; ranging from the Arctic pack ice through to subarctic and temperate waters in the North East Atlantic. The species typically breeds on cliffs and rock faces, occasionally in sand dunes or on flatter ground (e.g., North Rona, Scotland), sometimes > 2 km inland (up to 10 km in Svalbard); in places it nests near habitation, sometimes even on occupied houses along seafronts of towns (Carboneras et al. 2014). Its diet is variable, but includes fish (e.g., capelin (Mallotus villosus), Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii), whiting (Merlangius merlangus)), squid and zooplankton, especially amphipods (Thysanoessa, Hyperia, Gammarus, Themisto) and jellyfish (e.g., Aurelia aurita, Cyanea capillata, Rhizostoma octopus); also fish offal and carrion. In the North Sea its diet includes mainly lesser sandeels (Ammodytes marinus) (Carboneras et al. 2014).";;The species was subject to intensive exploitation for food in the past, and hunting remains in Greenland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands (Thorup et al. 2014).  In some breeding colonies the species is susceptible to predation from invasive mammals, such as foxes, rats, mice etc. It is vulnerable to oil spills, particularly in the North East Atlantic, but increasingly in its Northern range (Mendel et al. 2008). It is highly susceptible to ingesting marine litter and plastics (Van Franeker et al. 2011). Bycatch in fisheries is also a significant threat, with large numbers recorded as caught in longline fisheries in the North East Atlantic and in trawl fisheries (Dunn et al. 2001, Anderson et al. 2011) as well as in gillnet fisheries (Žydelis et al. 2013) . It is susceptible to collision and displacement from offshore wind farms, although this is currently considered to be a very low risk (Bradbury et al. 2014). It may also be disturbed and displaced by shipping lanes. Large wrecks of this species in North Sea in Feb 2004 thought to be caused by multiple factors, namely low food abundance, persistent bad weather, higher levels of pollutants, and secondary diseases (Van Franeker 2004).
B12;Pterodroma_madeira;This species breeds on ledges on inland cliffs at 1600 m. Good vegetation and sufficient earth to dig burrows is essential for nesting (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). During the day it is seen no closer than 3–5 km to the shore and only returns at night (Tucker and Heath 1994). The breeding season begins in early April with egg-laying occurring May to early June. Clutch size is a single egg (Carboneras et al. 2014). Little is known about the diet but regurgitated material has contained small fish, squid and crustaceans (Tucker and Heath 1994). The species is migratory however there is little information on where it goes outside of the breeding season. Current evidence indicates most birds disperse widely to Mauritania and Senegal, NE Brazil, and the tropical waters along the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge to St Helena and west of the Gulf of Guinea (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;Following the removal of all livestock from the breeding areas, the ecosystem had been recovering well prior to the 2010 fire, although breeding only occurs on ledges that were never accessible to grazing animals (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). The fire in 2010 (see Zino and Biscoito 2011) highlights the vulnerability of the species to such events, since it breeds on only six ledges at one location. As well as having a catastrophic impact on the survival of the year's fledglings and some adults, fires also increase soil erosion and make the habitat more barren, making the chicks more vulnerable to predation (P. Oliveira in litt. 2010). Currently, the main threats are predation of eggs and chicks by introduced black rats (Rattus rattus) and of nesting adults by feral cats (Felis catus). The increasing number of visitors at night may also cause disturbance to breeding birds, although this is being carefully monitored by the relevant authorities (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). The sole remaining breeding site is threatened by the construction of a NATO radar station on the summit of Mt Areeiro which began in November 2009. Although an Environmental Impact Assessment has been conducted to minimise the threat to the species, is it still feared that the construction and presence of the station will have a negative impact (Barov and Derhé 2011). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its altitudinal distribution falls entirely within 1,000 m of the highest mountain top within its range (1,861 m) (BirdLife International unpublished data). Shepherds formerly collected juveniles for food, and egg-collectors have raided nest-burrows in the past.
B18;Puffinus_assimilis;The species is marine and is normally found in offshore waters, but also pelagic and near land in the vicinity of colonies. It breeds on oceanic islands and rocky offshore islets, occupying cliffs and earthy slopes, usually with little more than herbaceous vegetation, or amongst rocks. In the north-east Atlantic it breeds mainly late February to March (Carboneras et al. 2014). It breeds from late January in the, birds from the Salvages (Madeira) arrive at colonies in July. The species is colonial, often nesting at low densities and in small numbers, sometimes in mixed colonies with other species, for example Calonectris diomedea, which out-competes the present species for burrows in the Azores (Monteiro et al. 1996). It nests in rock crevices or self-excavated burrows and clutch size is a single egg. It feeds mainly on fish, squid and crustaceans. Little is known about the species’s movements. Adults are thought to be largely sedentary and immatures probably more dispersive (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;"This species is vulnerable to human exploitation; along, with habitat destruction this may be responsible for some local extinctions and near-extinctions. In the Canary Islands, light-induced mortality has been reported (Carboneras et al. 2014). Other potential threats are marine pollution, predation by introduced species, development for tourism, collection for consumption and bycatch from fisheries (Madroño et al. 2004)."
B17;Puffinus_mauretanicus;This species is marine, usually found around inshore waters (del Hoyo et al. 2014). It breeds on cliffs and small islets and lays only one egg. Adult birds do not breed until their third year (Oro et al. 2004). Breeding occurs between February and June (Ruiz & Martí 2004). The species nests in colonies, in rock crevices or on cave ledges lined sparsely with plant material. It feeds mostly on small shoaling fish, squid and crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 2014). After breeding, most birds leave the Mediterranean for the Atlantic coast of south-west Europe, mainly Portugal, north-west Spain and the Bay of Biscay (Ruiz and Martí 2004, Ramírez et al. 2008, Arcos et al. 2009).;;"This is a long-lived species and therefore immediate threats affect adult mortality rates. Adult survival is the main conservation concern, as this is unusually low for a Procellariiform (Oro et al. 2004). In accordance, the main threats identified are predation by introduced carnivores such as cats, martens and genets in the breeding colonies (Arcos and Oro 2004, Ruiz and Martí 2004, Jones et al. 2008, Arcos 2011) and fisheries by-catch at sea (Arcos 2011). The species's gregarious behaviour and its close association with fishing boats means that occasional mass mortality is likely to occur when long-line boats fish close to flocks (Arcos et al. 2008) and it appears that bycatch is fairly common but often occurs on an irregular basis, suggesting that estimates derived from observations on a limited number of trips onboard fishing vessels could be largely underestimates (Boue et al. 2013). Increasing evidence on this has been compiled in the last few years, with events of up to a hundred or more birds caught in a single event, in occasions involving other fishing gear such as purse-seiners (ICES 2008, Louzao et al. 2011). Due to the congregatory behaviour of the species, acute pollution events such as oil spills also pose a very serious threat as a large number of casualties could result from a spill occurring in a congregation area (Ruiz and Martí 2004, Gutiérrez 2011). Other threats include: the reduction of prey due to fishing overexploitation; a potential reduction in fishing discards (an alternative to the overexploited natural prey) and/or anthropogenic environmental change (Arcos 2011); habitat degradation and disturbance in the breeding grounds; background pollution (Oro et al. 2008); the development of marine windfarms (Arcos 2011a); and human harvesting (nowadays a relict activity). Predation by Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) in the breeding colonies has also been recently reported (García 2009, Wynn et al. 2010), though this should be considered as a factor of natural mortality that likely has little influence on the decline of the species. The gradual northward movement of the non-breeding population may be affecting adult survival, and this shift may be due to climate change or alterations in fish distributions as a result of fisheries' activities (Yésou 2003, Wynn and Yésou 2007). The recent demographic decline has not yet decreased the species's genetic variability and connectivity found among colonies at least does not exacerbate the species's extinction risk (Genovart et al. 2007)."
B15;Puffinus_puffinus;"Breeding starts in March, and the species forms colonies on coastal or offshore islands, nesting in burrows (Carboneras et al. 2014). At sea this species is mainly found on waters over the continental shelf, feeding predominantly on small shoaling fish (Clupea harengus, Sprattus sprattus, Ammodytes marinus) but also on some squid, crustaceans and offal. It feeds mainly by pursuit-plunging and pursuit-diving; also by surface-seizing and pattering either alone or in small flocks (Carboneras et al. 2014).";;Considerable human exploitation continues in the Azores and in Islands of Madeira (Carboneras et al. 2014) and legal harvesting (1,000–5,000 chicks per annum) also continues on the Faeroe Islands (Thorup et al. 2014). The species suffers predation by rats and feral cats at many of its breeding colonies (control programmes are in effect at some, while additional work is planned) (Zonfrillo 2007). Light pollution causing mortality has been recorded at some sites (e.g., Canary Islands) (Carboneras et al. 2014) and the species may also be displaced from foraging areas by shipping lanes. Habitat destruction and fire induced damage to breeding colonies within the Canary Islands is believed to impact on the species. The species is vulnerable to oil spills (Votier et al. 2005) and to other types of marine water pollution (Camphuysen et al. 2010). The species is vulnerable to being caught as fisheries bycatch, including in longlines and gillnets (Žydelis et al. 2013).  While the increasing number of wind farms may cause collisions or displacement, it is currently considered a very low risk for this species (Bradbury et al. 2014).
B16;Puffinus_yelkouan;This species is marine, frequenting mostly inshore waters. It breeds on rocky coastal and offshore islets, and on the mainland (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is a colonial breeder, nesting in rock crevices or ledges in caves, occasionally in old rabbit burrows, lined with sparse plant material. It sometimes nests on cliffs. Clutch is a single white egg. The species forages mostly by pursuit-plunging and pursuit-diving. Diet composition varies through the year but consists mostly of fish, squid and crustacea (Carboneras et al. 2014). In the non-breeding season it disperses widely within the Mediterranean and Black Seas, often congregating in large flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998).;;"The most serious threat to the species is mortality from incidental fishing bycatch, followed by predation by invasive predators (predominantly rats (Rattus rattus) and to a lesser extent, feral cats (Felis catus)). A study in France and Malta (Oppel et al. 2011) implicated fishing bycatch as a critical cause of mortality for the species, since the majority of the adult mortality of birds breeding in Malta occurred during the non-breeding season. This pattern is consistent with the presumed cause of low adult survival probabilities in the Balearic Shearwater (Oro et al. 2004, Tavecchia et al. 2008). Long-liners in particular affect the species (Arcos et al. 2008, Louzao et al. 2011), often on an irregular basis, but impacting fairly large numbers at a time. Since Procellariiforms are generally long-lived, their populations are highly sensitive to changes in adult survival. The increased adult mortality induced by accidental bycatch is therefore a significant danger to them and a highly important threat (Lebreton 2000). These shearwaters have been shown to suffer substantial predation pressure by introduced mammalian predators on breeding grounds (Bourgeois et al. 2008, Bonnaud et al. 2009) with observed population declines in Italy being attributed to alien predators, predominantly rats (Sultana and Borg 2006, Capizzi et al. 2010), which heavily limit reproductive success by predation upon chicks and eggs. On the Tavolara archipelago, Italy, the colony size has been much reduced in the last 30 years and vast sectors of the islands have been deserted; breeding success was assessed for the first time in 2006 and it was found to be zero (due to rat predation) in several colonies (J. J. Borg in litt. 2006). Feral cats are a major threat. On the Hyères islands (French Mediterranean coast), feral cats have been identified as the primary predator of the species: shearwater remains were found in up to 6% of cat scats, representing hundreds of adults killed each year, especially during the pre-breeding period (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). Increasing tourism and coastal urbanization in the Mediterranean create sound and light disturbances at colonies and damages fragile breeding habitats (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008, Oppel et al. 2011). Breeding success may be affected by reduced abundance of anchovies and sprats due to competition from fisheries (Bourgeois and Vidal 2008). The gregarious behaviour of this species makes it particularly vulnerable to oil spills and the intense maritime traffic in the Mediterranean and Bosporus increases the risk of oil spills. Less prominent threats include competition for nest sites with Cory's Shearwater, collisions with wind turbines, pollution and contaminants (e.g. plastic (R. Crnkovic in litt. 2012)), environmental events (such as toxic algal blooms and geological erosion) and illegal hunting (Derhé 2012)."
B242;Pterocles_alchata;The species inhabits steppe habitats requiring dry, open grassland plains without trees or high bushes (de Juana 1989). It favours lowland plains with a mosaic of natural pastures, arable fields and uncultivated sandy or saline land (Cramp 1985). In Spain it requires reasonable amounts of fallow and stubble land and this is probably true elsewhere (Suárez et al. 1997). It often associates with the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) particularly in winter (Martín et al. 2010b). It lays between April and August but mostly in May-June (Madge and McGowan 2012). On average it lays three eggs (Urban et al. 1986). The nest is a slight scrape or natural depression in the ground and is usually unlined (Madge and McGowan 2002). It mainly feeds on seeds, but to a lesser extent also green shoots and leaves (de Juana and Kirwan 2013). The species is sedentary and nomadic in Europe (Rasmussen and Anderton 2005).;In central Spain it avoids cereal crops, olive groves and vineyards (Martín et al. 2010a). It also avoids dense scrub, tall crops and hilly areas and is typically found below 1,000 m (Madge and McGowan 2002). ;This species is declining due to changes in agricultural practices (Madge and McGowan 2002). In Spain, 55% of disturbance to the species came from raptors, although mammalian predators and man were also sources of disturbance (Ferns and Hinsley 1994).
B243;Pterocles_orientalis;The species inhabits dry grassland steppe (Tucker & Heath 1994). It favours open, treeless steppes or pseudo-steppes which incorporate uncultivated areas, fallow land and arable stubbles (Cramp 1985). It tolerates occasional shrubs or trees and occupies foothills and upland plateaux (de Juana and Boesman 2013). It lays between March and August with timing dependent on latitude, generally laying in April in the Canary Islands and mostly June in Spain and the former USSR with replacement clutches until September (de Juana and Boesman 2013). It normally lays three eggs (de Juana and Boesman 2013). The nest is an uncovered, bare scrape in bare, stony areas such as those found on the edges of ploughed fields (Tucker and Heath 1994). It often feeds on small or very small seeds apparently preferring Leguminosae, as well as cereal grain and cultivated legumes (de Juana and Boesman 2013). It is sedentary in Iberia and nomadic or partially migratory in Turkey (de Juana and Boesman 2013).;;"The main threat to this species is the intensification of agriculture. Ploughing of pasture and irrigation have reduced available habitat while the removal of marginal areas of semi-natural vegetation and the increased application of agro-chemicals has reduced food availability and these practices have probably been responsible for the extinctions in some areas. On the remaining grasslands, overgrazing affects the vegetation composition and structure, reducing both food availability and cover for nesting. Conversely, land abandonment is also a major threat, as the open, treeless steppe habitat is quickly lost when grazing is removed. Hunting, which is legal in Turkey during the breeding season, may be a problem; the species's habit of concentrating in large numbers at traditional drinking sites throughout the year means that it forms an attractive and relatively easy target (Tucker and Heath 1994)."
B265;Aegolius_funereus;The species occupies coniferous (taiga) forests, breeding mainly in spruce (Picea) forests but also uses mixed forests of pine (Pinus), birch (Betula) and aspen (Populus tremula) and even uses pure pine forests (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Breeding may begin in February, in good vole years (Mikkola 1983) and continue until July (Holt et al. 1999) but most eggs are laid in April. It nests in holes, such as disused woodpecker holes or where these are not available it will use nest boxes. No nest is made and eggs are laid directly onto debris, although if there is soft material in the hole it will make a shallow depression (Mikkola 1983). Clutches are usually three to seven eggs. It feeds principally on small voles as well as mice, shrews and small birds (Snow and Perrins 1998), but also recorded taking flying squirrels, bats, frogs and beetles (Mikkola 1983). This species is generally a year-round resident within a stable home range, but it disperses in years when prey is scarce (Holt et al. 1999).;;The breeding population of this species fluctuates with vole cycles and the depth of annual snow cover, which inhibits foraging. Forestry can reduce primary prey populations, remove forest structure necessary for foraging, and eliminate nest cavities (Holt et al. 1999). At one time the species frequently used old Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) holes but declines in the species has resulted in less nesting opportunities (Mikkola 1983). Tawny owls (Strix aluco) and martens (Martes spp.) are serious predators of this species and in some years the latter can destroy a high percentage of broods and kill many females on the nest. In Germany, the Nuthatch (Sitta europea) may reduce the size of nest-hole entrances with plastered mud and has even been known to wall in brooding females, resulting in the birds starving to death. It is also vulnerable to pesticides (König et al. 2008)
B267;Asio_flammeus;The species occupies open country such as, tundra, marsh, grassland, moorland, as well as montane forest. In Europe, this species breeds mainly on tundra, moorland, marshes and bogs, in newly cleared forest and young evergreen plantations, in uncultivated grassland and in steppe (Olsen et al. 2013). It breeds between late march and June and generally lays seven to ten eggs (König 2008). It nests on the ground on a dry site, sometimes in wetter situation and female shows tendency to build nest (almost unique behaviour among Strigidae) (Olsen et al. 2013). It feeds mostly on small mammals but also other small vertebrates and insects (König 2008), but usually relies on rodent populations which can determine its spatial distribution and nesting success (Hagemejer and Blair 1997). In the north of its range it is thought to be highly migratory although migration may be confused with nomadic food searches and juvenile dispersal. Wintering areas may also become breeding areas if food is plentiful (Olsen et al. 2013).;;"Due to its nesting habits and nomadic nature, the species is vulnerable to habitat loss at any season; conversion of open habitats to agriculture, grazing, recreation, housing and resort development is a key factor in decline, as well as reforestation in some areas. Wind-turbine developments may also impact the species. In central Europe declines have been caused by drainage and the intensification of agriculture, together with persecution, rodenticide poisoning, urbanization and traffic mortality. It does not always occupy apparently suitable habitat, which may be due to levels of prey or predation or the effects of distribution and abundance. Domestic and feral cats and dogs cause disturbance (Olsen et al. 2013)."
B266;Asio_otus;This species breeds in dense vegetation adjacent to open areas such as grassland or shrubland, including open forest, nesting and roosting in forest. In mainland Europe, breeding occurs in edge woodland and scrub and in Britain it favours shelterbelts, small groves and thickets surrounded by moorland, grassland, marshes or farmland. Outside the breeding season it is found in similar habitats, including farmland with hedgerows. The breeding season is from February to July (Olsen 1999). It uses the abandoned stick nests of other species, such as crows (Corvus), magpies (Pica), raptors, herons (Ardea) (König and Weick 2008). It also accepts artificial baskets, and sometimes lays in cavities in trees or cliffs, or on the ground. Clutches are generally five to seven eggs. It feeds principally on small mammals, although some studies have found birds to be important (Olsen 1999). The species is mainly migratory in Fennoscandia and Russia but further south in Europe it is more sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Declines in Britain are thought to be due to the expanding population of Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), competing for space, food and nest sites (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Olsen 1999). Agricultural intensification and declining vole populations are also driving declines in Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Locally, threats include pesticide use, persecution and road traffic collisions (König and Weick 2008).
B264;Athene_noctua;The species is found in a variety of habitats, ranging from parkland, orchards and cultivated fields with hedges to rocky, semi-desert regions and steppes (Mikkola 1983) and extends from boreal to tropical areas. It is monogamous and breeds from March to August. The nest is built in a cavity and the hole is cleaned and scraped but will also use nest boxes. Clutches are usually three to six eggs (Holt et al. 2014). It feeds on insects, small rodents and plant matter. Birds and frogs are an important food source during the nesting season (Mikkola 1983). The species is sedentary although large displacements do occur (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Population levels can suffer marked decreases after severe winters. Its range has contracted locally in many parts of Europe, which is thought to be mainly due to habitat changes, including the loss of suitable nest-sites and, less often, the use of pesticides. Industrialised farming practices have resulted in a reduction of prey items such as voles and earthworms. Agricultural intensification, ground clearance, excessive use of toxic chemicals and road traffic deaths all contribute to declines as well (Holt et al. 2014). The loss of nest holes from the felling of old hollow trees and the restoration of old buildings is also likely to affect the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B257;Bubo_bubo;This species inhabits mainly rocky country with cliffs and ravines, caves, patches of woodland, scattered trees or groves, generally in undisturbed wilderness areas. It also uses open forest, taiga and other types of woodland, wooded steppe, river valleys with gorges, overgrown quarries and farmland with suitable rocky areas or cliffs. The species is monogamous and breeds from February to August in Scandinavia, however egg-laying occurs in December in France. It nests on sheltered cliff ledges or in crevices, in a cave entrance, on the ground on steep slope or on flatter ground in taiga. The same site is often used for several years or in rotation with other favoured sites. Clutches are usually two to four eggs (Holt et al. 2013). It feeds mostly on mammals from small rodents to hares and birds to the size of herons and buzzards, but it also consumes reptiles, frogs, fish and larger insects. It also preys on other owl species in its range (König 2008). The species is resident in most of its range and juveniles disperse over variable distances (Holt et al. 2013).;Occasionally it uses old tree nests of other species and rarely in hole in tree. ;Most declines are due to human activity. It is extremely sensitive and the slightest disturbance can cause the abandonment of the nest. Unfortunately cross-country skiing, mountaineering, alpinism and other leisure activities often take people unknowingly near nests (Tucker and Heath 1994). It suffers from human persecution and poisoning from mercury seed-dressings, and deaths through road traffic, barbed wire (Holt et al. 2013) and overhead wires (Tucker and Heath 1994) are not insignificant (Holt et al. 2013). These threats still persist despite its protected status in most countries (König 2008). A significant decline in Mediterranean countries in the 1960s is thought to be due to the effects of myxomatosis on rabbit populations (Holt et al. 2013). Egg-collectors impose a relatively high level of nest-robbing on the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B258;Bubo_scandiacus;"This species breeds in open tundra or quasi-tundra  from sea level up to 1,500 m Asl (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), with hummocks, rocks or other low prominences, and sparse low vegetation and dwarf shrubs and lichen. In winter it also occupies marshes, fields and dunes. It breeds between May and September and is monogamous, often pairing for life but occasional incidents of polygyny and polyandry occur. The male performs an undulating courtship flight; a series of flaps followed by glide with wings held in dihedral. The nest is a shallow scrape on ground, usually in slightly elevated site providing a good view. Clutch size varies with food supply, generally 3–5 eggs when limited, 7–11 when plentiful (Holt et al. 2015). It feeds principally on small and medium-sized rodents such as lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) (Tucker and Heath 1994). Other prey taken according to availability and includes birds to the size of ptarmigans (Lagopus), ducks and medium-sized geese, occasionally fish, amphibians, crustaceans and beetles. The species is mostly migratory and nomadic (Holt et al. 2015). Juvenile wintering areas lie south of the adult areas and females winter further north than males. Some birds may sometimes move as far south as central Europe (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;Harvesting of species for food, feathers and claws by native peoples may have local impact on population, but unlikely to have any wider effect on total numbers. Electrocution and airplane strikes may also threaten this species (Holt et al. 2015). Climate change has a significant impact on the onset of spring and snowmelt in the breeding areas which may change the availability of prey for the species (International Snowy Owl Working Group 2010).
B263;Glaucidium_passerinum;"The species occupies coniferous and mixed forests and is found mainly in tall forest interior, dominated by conifers and often interspersed with beech (Fagus), aspen (Populus), birch (Betula) and other broadleaved trees used for nesting. It occurs in taiga and montane forest and in lowlands at upper and middle latitudes; in temperate zone ranging from 250–300 m in narrow cool and moist ravines (Holt et al. 1999). It is monogamous and breeds from April to July. The nest is in a tree cavity, either a natural hole or one excavated by a woodpecker; it will also make use of nestboxes. Debris is removed from the hole and no material is added to it (Holt et al. 1999, Mikkola 1983). Clutches are usually four to seven eggs. It feeds on small mammals, especially voles, although also shrews (Sorex), bats (Myotis) and mice (Micromys, Apodemus) and small birds (Holt et al. 1999). The species is mainly resident, although some dispersal occurs during winter and bad weather and low prey numbers can cause irruptive movements (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).";;Breeding densities and numbers can fluctuate significantly with weather conditions and rodent cycles. Despite large scale deforestation in Finland, there is no evidence of population declines there, however in west Germany its disappearance in many areas has been linked to destruction of forests and the resulting changes in ecosystem, such as increase in population of Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) at higher elevations (Holt et al. 1999). It is also thought that acid rain damage in conjunction with increasing forest disease will weaken trees to storm damage and result in changes in the ecosystem and increased predation from S. aluco again (König et al. 2008).
B255;Otus_brucei;This species frequents semi-open areas with trees and bushes, including cultivation, palm groves, orchards, riverine woodland as well as parks and large gardens in towns. It generally prefers more arid areas than Otus scops. Pairing begins on arrival at breeding areas, normally in March with laying occurring April to May. The nest is built 3–6.5 m above ground in a hollow tree or old woodpecker hole. It often favours poplar (Populus), willow (Salix) or mulberry (Morus) but also uses cavities in banks, walls, cliffs or buildings as well as nest boxes. Clutch size is four to six eggs. It feeds on insects, spiders, small mammals, birds and lizards, depending on availability. It hunts from a perch, dropping down to take prey from branches or the ground. Also known to pursue and catch aerial prey such as bats and moths. The species is resident and migratory. In Europe, it is most likely a summer visitor to Turkey arriving late March or April and leaving in September or October (Holt et al. 1999).;;The threats to this species are not well known (Holt et al. 1999). Pesticides may be a potential danger to this species (König 2008)
B256;Otus_scops;This species is found in semi-open areas which contain a mosaic of fallow land and copses and include old trees for daytime shelter and a breeding site. It also uses riverine forests, olive and almond groves, old fruit plantations, parks and gardens, tree-lined village streets and even town centres (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is mostly monogamous but occasionally polygynous and breeds from May to June (Holt et al. 1999). The nest is usually a hole in a tree or occasionally in walls, ruins, on the ground and in the old nests of magpies or other corvids. No material is added and typically four eggs are laid (Mikkola 1983). It feeds mostly on insects and other invertebrates and some small birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals (Holt et al. 1999). Northernmost populations are fully migratory, wintering from the Mediterranean to the Equator but most southern populations are partially migratory or sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;Declines in this species are most likely down to habitat changes and a reduction in insect populations (Holt et al. 1999), probably from the use of pesticides (König 2008). The spread of large-scale farming, modernisation of agricultural methods and the reduction in the number of hollow trees may have driven its extirpation from areas in France and Spain (Holt et al. 1999, König 2008). In Switzerland, suitable habitat has been fragmented by spread of viniculture and agricultural intensification (Holt et al. 1999). Locally, increases in predator populations, such as Tawny owls (Strix aluco) may lead to decreases in this species (König 2008). Hunting, along migration routes in Italy and Malta, are also thought to impact the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).
B259;Strix_aluco;The primary habitat of this species is broad-leaved forest, however it adapts well to man-made and altered habitats. It is found in urban areas, clear-felled areas and intensive agricultures. In woodland habitats it inhabits mixed conifer and broad-leaved forests, sub-alpine conifer forest and conifer plantations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It is monogamous and pairs for life, although is occasionally bigamous. The breeding season is from February to July (Holt et al. 1999). It nests in holes in trees, cliffs, buildings and steep river banks. Also often uses, nestboxes, the old nests of large birds, burrows of large mammals (König 2008), dreys of squirrels (Sciurus) (Holt et al. 1999) and shallow depressions on the ground at the base of a tree or beneath a bush. Typically it lays three to five eggs (König 2008). It feeds on small mammals and small birds and will also consume amphibians, reptiles, earthworms, snails, beetles and other insects and occasionally fish (Holt et al. 1999). The species is sedentary and highly territorial (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).;;In Britain, human persecution drove declines during the 19th century (Holt et al. 1999). The species is reliant on prey availability, which is often determined by woodland structure. In the north, competition with the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) may limit the expansion of its range (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Locally, pesticide use, traffic and electrocution from powerlines also threaten this species (König 2008).
B261;Strix_nebulosa;"This species inhabits dense boreal or coniferous forest. It favours areas with openings; taiga interspersed with sphagnum bogs, muskeg or open fields; pine and fir forest adjacent to montane meadows; and tamarack, black spruce and aspen forest. It occasionally uses other habitats outside the breeding season, sometimes near habitation.

The breeding season is from March to August and the species is monogamous. It lays normally three to five eggs although clutches can range from two to nine depending on food availability. It lays in the abandoned nests of other birds of prey, on broken tree snags, sometimes on a mistletoe broom. In addition it will also use artificial platforms. No material added is added to the nest site (Holtet al. 1999). It feeds mostly on small mammals, particularly voles, but also takes shrews, squirrels, small hares, lemmings, birds, frogs and beetles (König 2008). In general the species is resident and nomadic; however movement patterns can be variable and are influenced by prey (Holt et al. 1999).";, or rarely in a shallow depression at the foot of a tree;The species is affected by global warming, which if it persists will continue to move the species’s range northwards (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Populations fluctuate in line with vole numbers (Cornulier et al. 2013). Locally, hunting may still be a threat (König 2008). It is also vulnerable to road traffic collisions and loss of habitat from forestry (Holt et al. 1999). Collisions with power lines and cables are also a threat.
B260;Strix_uralensis;The species occupies boreal forest and mixed woodland, with some open areas such as bogs, clearings or small fields, however, in central Europe, it is confined to deciduous woods, particularly of beech (Fagus sylvatica), in mountain areas. It is often found near human dwellings and also in pastureland (Holt et al. 1999). It is monogamous (König 2008) and breeds from February to July. It nests in tree holes or hollow stumps and will often use nestboxes. Also sometimes nest in cliff cavities or buildings, old raptor nests, crow nests (Corvus) or squirrel dreys (Sciurus). Clutches are usually three to four eggs. Its diet is made up of a large variety of mammals, birds, frogs, and insects, with voles, shrews, mice and rats as the main prey (König 2008). The species is extremely sedentary (Mikkola 1983).; and rarely on ground (Holt et al. 1999);In areas dominated by open areas, such as fields and clearfells, the Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) outcompetes this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). It also suffers from forestry management, which has resulted in the loss of hollow and broken trees which provide nesting sites (König 2008).
B262;Surnia_ulula;This species occupies forest tundra and boreal taiga as far as tree-line and ranging south to edge of forest steppe and cultivated land. It needs access to clearings, burnt areas, open peatland or muskeg, dry eminences or ridges, and sparse woodland, including birch, aspen and mixed woods. It breeds from March to September and nests in cavities, holes in trees, tops of stumps, nestboxes and  occasionally in the old nests of raptors or crows. Clutches are six to ten eggs (Holt et al. 2013). It feeds on small mammals, especially voles and small birds, hunting from an open perch, dropping or gliding on them (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is dispersive and irruptive (Holt et al. 2013).;;The species is dependent on rodent populations and numbers fluctuate with the abundance of small rodents. In Finland, the population has declined since 19th century, as a result of disappearance of hollow trees and through human persecution (Holt et al. 2013).
B254;Tyto_alba;This species is found in a great variety of habitats. It mainly occurs in open but not treeless, lowlands, especially farmlands with spinneys hedges, ditches, ponds and banks, and some rough grass or herbage, roadside verges, and similar rough terrain. Egg-laying occurs from March to September in Britain but the season may not be so prolonged around the Mediterranean. It nests in holes in trees or buildings, in a cliff, quarry, rock outcrops (Snow and Perrins 1998) and nest boxes (Bruce et al. 2014). It reuses nests for successive broods and in successive years. Clutches are usually four to seven eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). The diet is consists mainly of small mammals and is usually dominated by only a few species, especially rats and mice. The species is mostly sedentary, with post-breeding dispersal of juveniles (Bruce et al. 2014).;;The causes of decline include loss and fragmentation of grassland foraging habitat, intensification of agricultural practices, urbanization, and road development which is also linked to road mortalities. It also suffers from severe winters. Increased mechanization of farms has meant the loss of important foraging sites, such as stockyards and stables, and the loss of abandoned farm buildings suitable for nest-sites. Organochlorine pesticides in 1950s and 1960s and rodenticides in 1970s and 1980s had disastrous effects on many owl populations in Europe, particularly north-west Europe (Bruce et al. 2014).
B27;Phalacrocorax_pygmaeus;The species occurs in reedbeds, transition zones between reedbeds and open waters, extensively grazed or mowed shores and wet meadows and, in winter, in coastal wetlands, along rivers, and sometimes on inland lakes (Johnsgard 1993, Crivelli et al. 2000, BirdLife International 2004, Orta et al. 2014). The nest is a deep cup of sticks and reeds built near or over water in trees, bushes, reedbeds or on floating islets of vegetation (Johnsgard 1993, Nelson et al. 2005, Orta et al. 2014). The species breeds between April and July in large mixed-species colonies, leaving the breeding grounds towards the end of August and returning between March and April (Orta et al. 2014). The species is sedentary over much of its range with some populations migrating over short distances (Orta et al. 2014). Throughout the year it normally feeds singly or in small groups (Nelson et al. 2005, Orta et al. 2014). Diet consists predominantly of fish up to 15 cm long (Orta et al. 2014).;;The species is threatened by the degradation of wetlands through drainage for agriculture (Orta et al. 2014) and changes in hydrological regimes (Eken and Magnin 1999, Kazantzidis and Nazirides 1999, Crivelli et al. 2000) including increased eutrophication. It also suffers persecution from the aquaculture industry (Eken and Magnin 1999, Kazantzidis and Nazirides 1999, Crivelli et al. 2000, Orta et al. 2014). In south-east Europe, conservation measures have ameliorated the most important threats (Crivelli et al. 2000), although concern still exists regarding habitat destruction and persecution in its wintering range (Petkov, Nikolov and Velkov in litt. 2005). It is particularly vulnerable to being caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries (Žydelis et al. 2013). It is also susceptible to marine pollution, such as biocides and pesticides caused by agricultural run-off.
B26;Phalacrocorax_aristotelis;The species is a coastal species that shows high nesting site fidelity. The species breeds in colonies (Orta et al. 2014) that can hold more than a thousand well-spaced pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998, Nelson 2005). It is largely sedentary (Orta et al. 2014), although immatures may undergo post-breeding dispersive movements over short distances (Orta et al. 2014). Some birds undergo short-distance migrations during winter. Individuals often forage alone when away from nesting colonies and in winter (Orta et al. 2014, Snow and Perrins 1998), but may follow dense shoals of fish in flocks of several hundred individuals (Nelson 2005). It occupies marine habitats but does not usually occur far from land (Orta et al. 2014). It shows a strong preference for rocky coasts and islands (Orta et al. 2014) with adjacent deep, clear water (Nelson 2005), and forages over sandy and rocky seabeds (Orta et al. 2014). The species feeds on a wide range of benthic, demersal and schooling, pelagic fish. Sandeels (Ammodytidae) are the dominant prey of birds in British and some Spanish populations (Wanless et al. 1997, Velando and Friere 1999, BirdLife International 2000, Velando et al. 2005), and are consistently present in the species's diet in most other locations studied. These are usually caught at, or near, the sea bed (Wanless et al 1997). Other prey species include fish of the families Gadidae, Clupeidae, Cottidae, Labridae, and Trisopterus spp. (Orta et al. 2014), although birds also take small numbers of polychaetes, cephalopods, other molluscs and small benthic crustaceans (Wanless and Harris 1997). Adults provision their chicks with sandeels, but consume a broader variety of prey for themselves (BirdLife International 2000). The Mediterranean subspecies feeds mainly on coastal fishes, caught from the bottom or mid water over rocky or sandy seabeds, but economically important fish seem to form a very small part of the diet (Aguilar and Fernandez 1999).;;The species is persecuted (e.g., shot, intentionally drowned or poisoned) at commercial fisheries and fish farms as it is perceived to be a threat to fish stocks (Carss 1994, Wanless and Harris 1997). It also suffers predation at nesting colonies by introduced American mink (Neovison vison) (Wanless and Harris 1997), is vulnerable to coastal oil pollution (Wanless and Harris 1997, Velando et al. 2005), locally suffers from accidental entanglement and subsequent drowning in gill-nets (fishing nets) (Wanless and Harris 1997, Velando and Freire 2002), and is susceptible to the Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Kuiken 1999). Eggs, chicks and adults are taken from colonies for food (Wanless and Harris 1997).
B25;Phalacrocorax_carbo;Throughout its range the species is sedentary or locally dispersive, with northerly populations also making strong migratory movements (Orta et al. 2014). The species frequents both coastal and inland habitats (Brown et al. 1982, Johnsgard 1993, Snow and Perrins 1998, Nelson 2005, Orta et al. 2014). In marine environments it occurs in sheltered coastal areas on estuaries (Orta et al. 2014), saltpans, coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1993, Orta et al. 2014), deltas (Johnsgard 1993) and coastal bays (Brown et al. 1982), requiring rocky shores, cliffs and islets for nesting (Orta et al. 2014) . It also inhabits fresh, brackish or saline inland wetlands (Nelson 2005) including lakes, reservoirs, wide rivers, flood waters (Orta et al. 2014), deep marshes with open water, swamps and oxbow lakes (Johnsgard 1993), requiring trees, bushes, reedbeds or bare ground for nesting (Orta et al. 2014). The species's diet consists predominantly of fish, including sculpins, Capelin, gadids (Gremillet et al. 2004) and flatfish (Leopold et al. 1998) as well as crustaceans, amphibians (Orta et al. 2014), molluscs and nestling birds (Brown et al. 1982). At sea the species preys mostly on bottom-dwelling fish, occasionally also taking shoaling fish in deeper waters (Orta et al. 2014).;but generally avoiding deep water and rarely extending far offshore (Snow and Perrins 1998).  and avoiding overgrown, small, very shallow or very deep waters (Nelson 2005);The species is often persecuted by the aquaculture industry and may be shot, drowned or poisoned in attempts to control numbers (Carss 1994, ICN 2006) or for hunting (Bzoma et al. 2011). It may also suffer from disturbance and displacement from coastal wind farms (wind turbines) (Bradbury et al. 2014), and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease (Kuiken 1999) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these viruses (Kuiken 1999, Melville and Shortridge 2006). Recreational activities taking place at sea may also cause displacement from critical habitat. The species is susceptible to oil spills across its range.  It is also highly vulnerable to bycatch in gillnets (Žydelis et al. 2013), and the species is also caught in longlines (Bellebaum et al. 2009) and purse seines (Oliveira et al. 2015).
B24;Morus_bassanus;The species nests in large colonies on cliffs and offshore islands, but also on the mainland. This strictly marine species wanders mostly over continental shelves, feeding on shoaling pelagic fish such as herring (Clupea harengus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and sandeels (Ammodytes). Prey is mostly caught by plunge-diving from large heights. It also attends trawlers and will form large congregations where food is plentiful. Breeding is highly seasonal starting between March and April. Young birds will migrate to the extreme south of its range, whereas adults range less extensively but still regularly winter in the Mediterranean (Carboneras et al. 2014).;;"Overfishing and prey depletion is likely to affect this species, although populations in the U.K. and Ireland were not seriously affected by Shetland sandeel stock crash in the mid 1980s (Carboneras et al. 2014). Incidental capture in fishing gear, including in longlines and purse seines also poses a threat; and the species was the most commonly caught along the Portuguese mainland coast (Oliveira et al. 2015). The species is hunted for food in some places, for example, a small annual harvest is carried out on Sula Sgeir, off north-west Scotland. The small population of northern Norway has suffered local declines and extinctions thought to be mainly due to harassment by White-tailed Eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla). The species is considered at high risk from collisions with offshore wind turbines (Bradbury et al. 2014)."
M11;Alopex_lagopus;"The species is confined to arctic and alpine tundra, above or north of the treeline. The arctic fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger, but in most inland areas the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. In Fennoscandia, the Norwegian lemming Lemmus lemmus was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) (Frafjord 1995, Elmhagen et al. 2000). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Angerbjörn et al. 1995, Angerbjörn et al. 1999). The typical response to lemming peak-years is an increase in both the number of litters and litter size (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996). Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy especially in areas without cyclic rodent populations (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996, Dalerum and Angerbjörn 2000, Eide et al. 2005). In Iceland, lamb carcasses frequently are found among prey remains at dens resulting in the species being considered a pest. Although individual foxes may indeed prey on lambs, it is more likely that a large proportion of the lambs have been scavenged (Hersteinsson 1996). Arctic foxes are known to prey on wildfowl (Eide et al. 2005) and occasionally kill reindeer calves (Prestrud 1992a). Foxes reach sexual maturity at 10 months, and the average lifespan for animals that reach adulthood is approximately three years (Angerbjörn et al. 2004). In more stable coastal environments the average age is probably higher (Prestrud 1992a). Arctic fox life history traits reflect adaptations to differing constraints in resource availability. Arctic foxes in unstable environments (e.g., habitats dominated by cyclic prey) have higher litter size but do not reproduce every year, whereas arctic foxes in stable environments (e.g., coastal habitats with bird cliffs), have a smaller litter size but reproduce every year (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996, Angerbjörn et al. 2004). Social organization (home range size and territoriality) and hence local density of arctic fox is also highly influenced by resource availability; home range sizes range from 10 km2 in stable coastal habitats up to 52 km2 in more fluctuating environments (Angerbjörn et al. 1997, Strand et al. 2000, Eide et al. 2004). Hence predictable coastal habitats support a denser population of foxes compared to more unpredictable habitats. Arctic foxes tend to be territorial, with a mated pair occupying a common territory (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1986, Prestrud 1992b, Landa et al. 1998, Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1996, Eide et al. 2004). Additional, but non-reproductive adults may also be present within the territory even though their function as “helpers” may be somewhat limited. In some rare cases it has been observed that two adult females will reproduce within the same territory (Strand et al. 2000, Angerbjörn et al. 2004, Bodil Elmhagen pers. comm.). As a result of these home range sizes and territorial social organisation typical densities can vary from 20 adults per 100 km2 to 2-4 per 100 km2. A noticeable feature of arctic fox ecology is dependence on and year round use of dens. These dens are normally excavated in sandy soil and can reach a considerable size (Østbye et al. 1978, Dalerum et al. 2002, Frafjord 2003). After several decades, or even centuries, of use they can acquire many tens of openings. In areas without sandy deposits foxes use crevices in cliffs or moraines as dens (Prestrud 1992b).";;Globally the large populations on the continental tundra of Alaska, Canada and Siberia (except Kola) and the island of Greenland are all harvested by trapping or shooting. The main motivation is for fur, although they are killed around settlements in parts of Greenland to reduce the risk of rabies being spread to sled dogs and humans. There is nothing that indicates that these populations are currently threatened by overharvest. The small population on the Komandor islands is threatened by a form of mange (Otodectes cynotis: Goltsman et al. 1996).In Europe the threats vary between regions.The animals occupying western Siberia are exposed to trapping, but nothing indicates that this is representing an immediate threat. There is no other information available about threats to this population.On Svalbard arctic foxes are trapped, but the extent of this trapping is limited to areas close to settlements, and it is therefore not regarded as a threat (Fuglei et al. 1998). Possible threats include accumulation of long distance transported pollutants and climate change, which may influence sea ice conditions in the future. The arctic fox on Svalbard (Norway) has higher levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) than foxes in other parts of the arctic (Norheim 1978, Wang-Andersen et al. 1993, Fuglei et al. 2007). The levels are similar to those found in polar bears from Svalbard and Greenland (Verreault et al. 2005). Such high concentrations of contaminants may have possible toxic health effects. The island Bjørnøya holds a small, recently re-established population of arctic foxes, while no foxes have been reported on Jan Mayen since before 1998 (E. Fuglei pers comm. 2007). Arctic foxes on these islands are protected and the main threat appears to be lack of influx of new animals and the extremely small population size. These islands were part of the Svalbard metapopulation, as sea ice allowed connectivity. Climate change through reduction in the extent of the sea ice might in fact explain why the arctic fox has not re-established on Jan Mayen (E. Fuglei pers comm. 2007).On Iceland the status of arctic fox has changed. Historically they were heavily persecuted because of the belief that they were involved in depredation on livestock. Recent legislation has restricted harvest and the population is increasing (Hersteinsson 2006), although in many areas they are still hunted year round.In Fennoscandia arctic foxes are scattered along the peninsula in very small populations that are relatively isolated from each other. The alpine tundra habitat is naturally fragmented, but the degree of population fragmentation has increased due to the extinction of local populations. The populations have not increased despite over 75 years of protection. Overexploitation due to hunting and trapping was most probably the originate threat and the reason behind the dramatic decline of arctic foxes in Fennoscandia (Østbye et al. 1978, Hersteinsson et al. 1989, Angerbjörn et al. 1995, Linnell et al. 1999, Kaikusalo et al. 2000). The value of arctic fox fur together with high grants for killing foxes gave motivation for this strong persecution. In 1924 Norwegian trappers could get 25% more than an average year's salary for a peasant for only one skin (Østbye and Pedersen 1990). Establishment of the fox farm industry at the beginning of 1900 probably also forced the decline further. Live trapping of foxes also continued also after protection. Arctic fox den sites are easy to spot and several dens were dug out during the sixties to catch cubs to bring in to fur farms (Østbye et al. 1978).     The exact reason why the population in not responding to protection is not understood, but a range of factors are believed to be involved, including:Intraguild competition with red foxes. Red fox populations have increased and expanded in range throughout the 20th century, both in the boreal region and above the treeline to alpine tundra habitat (Selås and Vik 2006, Elmhagen et al. 2007). It is known that they have occupied former arctic fox dens in the most productive, low lying areas (Østbye et al. 1978, Linnell et al. 1999, Frafjord 2003, Tannerfeldt et al. 2002, Kaikusalo et al. 2000). Red foxes occupy the same niche and eat the same prey as arctic foxes (Elmhagen et al. 2002), they can kill arctic fox pups and adults (Frafjord et al. 1989, Tannerfeldt et al. 2002), and arctic foxes avoid breeding close to red foxes (Tannerfeldt et al. 2002). Therefore the potential for a negative effect is clearly present.Genetics. The remaining arctic fox populations are all very small and relatively isolated from each other. Today the population consists of four genetically distinct subpopulations with very little exchange of dispersing animals (Dalén et al. 2002, Dalén et al. 2006). Therefore the potential for inbreeding is high. So far there are no obvious signs of inbreeding depression but individual genetic variation was negatively associated with fitness (Dalén et al. unpublished). Although there is still a surprisingly high degree of variation, by comparison with historical samples it is clear that 25% of the variation has been lost (Nyström et al. 2006). Hybridization with arctic foxes that have escaped from fur farms has also been documented.  Genetic mapping revealed hybridization of genotypes originating from escaped farm foxes (Norén et al. 2005), mixing in haplotypes not found in the wild Fennoscandian arctic fox (Dalén et al. 2005). The amount of reported escapes of farm foxes has increased in recent years and even breeding has been observed (N.E. Eide pers. comm. 2006). However at present demographic stochasticity probably remains a greater threat than inbreeding.Small population size. The small size of populations directly increases their individual risks of extinction, especially when they occupy a fluctuating environment with strong year to year variation in the probability of reproducing (Linnell et al. 1999, Loison et al. 2001). Extinction risk is further increased by fragmentation, which reduces the chance of rescue effects occurring (Dalén et al. 2006).Climate change. Projected climate change would intensify fragmentation of the Fennoscandian mountain plateau even further, and may exclude the arctic fox from lower lying alpine tundra areas. For a review of the potential impacts of climate change on arctic foxes see Ims and Fuglei (2005).
M30;Canis_aureus;Globally, it occupies a wide range of habitats, from the Sahel desert to the evergreen forests of south-east Asia (Sillero-Zubiri et al. 2004). In Europe, it prefers cultivated areas and wetlands in lower elevations, with adequate cover to be used for hiding and breeding. Dense continuous forests and large intensively cultivated areas without cover are not suitable. Moderate human activity may benefit the jackal, as it tends to increase availability of food (carrion, refuse, and animal dung) (Giannatos 2004). In Central Europe (Hungary) the dominant food of golden jackal is small mammals, and the trophic niche overlap with red foxes is usually high, although the jackal seems to be more carnivorous and more specialist than the fox (Lanski and Heltai 2002, Lanski et al. 2006).;;In Greece, population declines have been linked to loss of suitable habitat caused by changes in agricultural practices (intensification), specifically the loss of scrubby patches used as cover (Giannatos 2004). Changes in animal husbandry may have reduced the food base. Throughout its range, the species is widely persecuted as a pest.
M295;Vulpes_vulpes;In Europe it is found in a very wide variety of habitats including all types of forest and open landscapes. It is well adapted to many anthropogenic habitats including farmland and suburban and urban areas (Larivière and Pasitschniak-Arts 1996, Stubbe 1999). Red foxes are adaptable and opportunistic omnivores, with a diet ranging from invertebrates (e.g. earthworms and beetles) to mammals and birds (including game birds), and fruit. They also scavenge in rural areas (e.g. in Europe and Canada on deer and sheep carcasses which may be the major food source in upland areas inwinter), and in urban areas (on bird tables, compost heaps and refuse) (Sillero-Zubiri et al. 2004).;;It is hunted for sport, and is persecuted as a pest (Stubbe 1999). However, this is not a threat to the survival of the species.
M294;Vulpes_corsac;The corsac typically inhabits steppes, semi-deserts and deserts, . In the western part of the range they occur in low-grass steppe. In Kaspyi Sea region the steppes and tarragon-cereal semi-deserts are favoured. It also occurs in fixed-sand habitats (Nogaiskaya Steppe). In Volgo-Ural watershed the corsac inhabits most usual habitats, but prefers semi-deserts. To the east of the Ural Mountains, the species inhabits steppes and in favourable years occurs even in forested steppes. In Kazakhstan typical habitats are low grass steppes and semi-deserts, often inhabiting low hills. In Middle-Asia it inhabits semi-deserts and ephemeral-deserts. One limiting factor is snow height in winter, preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed.Corsac foxes appear to depend on distribution of ground squirrels and marmots for food and shelter (the burrows being enlarged and used for refuge).;, avoiding dense and tall grass steppes. avoiding mountains, forested areas and dense bush. , but avoiding low mountains. s, avoiding drifting sand. , and this species avoids areas where the depth of snow exceeds 150 mm;Development in Kazakhstan in the mid-1850s caused a significant reduction of corsac numbers in previously undisturbed habitats. In the 20th century several catastrophic population declines were recorded. During such crashes hunting on corsac foxes in the former Soviet Union was banned. For example, hunting of corsac foxes was stopped within the entire Kazakhstan territory from 1928 to 1938. Current population status, and the nature of major threats, is unknown in most regions. The western part of the range populations are recovering and their range expanding. In Kalmikiya large desert areas are changing into grass steppes, less suitable for corsac foxes. In Middle Asia and Kazakhstan a dramatic decrease of livestock during the last decade influenced many ecosystems and wildlife populations. However, the exact influence of this process on corsac populations remains unknown.Corsac pelts have been intensively traded. In general, over much of Russia during the 19th century, as many as 40,000–50,000 corsac pelts were traded in some years. For the time being, corsac pelts are not as highly appreciated as red fox pelts, and corsac foxes are usually trapped only incidentally.
M31;Canis_lupus;Wolves live in diverse habitat types and their broad distribution ranges show the species' adaptability to the most extreme habitat conditions. The wolf's habitat has been described as everywhere where humans do not kill it and where there is something to eat. Where wolves depend on wild ungulate prey, their habitat is that of their prey. Habitat quality should thus be interpreted in terms of human disturbance, prey densities and range size. In general, large forest areas are particularly suitable for wolves in Europe, although wolves are not primarily a forest species. The wolf has a very diversified diet and is a true generalist that feeds opportunistically on what is most available in its habitat. The wolf diet may include large prey, such as moose, deer and wild boar, or small vertebrates, invertebrates, vegetables and carcasses. Diet composition throughout the geographic range and seasonal variations depends on the relative abundance of potential prey, as well as accessibility and availability. A wolf typically requires 3-5 kg of meat per day, although it can fast for several days when food is not readily available.;;"Human intolerance is perhaps the greatest threat facing wolves in Europe today. Fear, misunderstanding and the fact that wolves do kill livestock have prompted an uneasy relationship with people in many areas, leading to direct conflict and persecution. In some countries unrestricted hunting of wolves poses a threat, while in others, licenses for killing wolves are issued irrespective of biological understanding. Poaching is widespread and probably represents the most important mortality factor for the wolf in Europe. Wolves preying on domestic animals have been a problem since man progressed from hunter/gatherer to farmer, and although the numbers of sheep or cattle taken are, as a percentage very low, livestock depredation remains the primary reason for exterminating wolves. Human encroachment is the most significant threat to wolf habitat. Wolves can live close to humans but they require safe areas in which to retreat. This is not considered in land planning in wolf areas and the small, fragmented populations in Western Europe can result in animals moving into unsuitable habitat. Specific threats to different European wolf populations are as follows:1. IberiaIllegal killing is still common (estimated to account for 50% of the total mortality) and poison baits are used (Blanco and Cortés 2002, Álvares 2005). 2. Western-Central AlpsDocumented causes of mortality include primarily car or train accidents and poaching events. Several cases of illegal killings have been reported in France and Italy, and conflicts with hunters and farmers are constantly reported. Both France and the Regional Government of Piemonte have been carrying out extensive and continuous research and monitoring of the wolf population and the damages to livestock and excellent data is available for management purposes. The number of livestock depredations in the Italian Alps is decreasing, despite the increase in wolf numbers, due to the high efforts in the implementation of preventive practices promoted by the Regional Government of Piemonte. Also if the wolf presence is still far from being accepted by local farmers and livestock breeders, the general attitude is improving (Boitani 2003, Marucco et al. 2005, Tropini et al. 2005).3. Italian peninsulaThe population is protected on paper but the law is poorly enforced and unpersecuted illegal killing is very common throughout the range. Poison baits are increasingly used against dogs, foxes and wolves. Hybridization with dogs has been found and it appears to account for at least 5% of the total wolf population (Ciucci and Boitani 1998, Corsi et al. 1999, Boitani 2003, Verardi et al. 2006). 4. Dinaric-BalkanLegal hunting and illegal killing are taking an unknown number of wolves throughout most of the range. Other pressures are commonly reported: widespread use of poisons, habitat fragmentation due to construction of fenced highways and shortage of wild preys (Huber et al. 2002, Iliopoulos 2005).5. CarpathianPoison baits and illegal killing are widespread throughout the range. In Ukraine, wolves are often treated as a pest species.6. BalticThe Latvian population appears to be on the way to being divided into two, with the area south of Riga starting to appears as a carnivore free area. This development will greatly increase the vulnerability of carnivore populations in western Latvia. 7. KareliaThe main threat to wolves in this region is killing by humans. In Finland, wolves cause very limited damage to livestock; predation on domestic dogs is the most frequent damage that cause strong resentment from the public. 8. ScandinaviaThe inbreeding coefficient is very high, on average higher than for full siblings mating (Liberg et al. 2005). Predation on domestic dogs, sheep and reindeer are the most frequent damages that cause continuing debate on wolf conservation.9. Germany/western PolandThe main risk for this population is its very small size, highly fragmented internal structure, and long distance from any other source. Coordination between Germany and western Poland is crucial. A single litter of wolf-dog hybrid pups was born in 2003."
M104;Lynx_lynx;Throughout Europe and Siberia, lynx are associated primarily with forested areas which have good ungulate populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Central Asia they occur in more open, thinly wooded areas. Small ungulates are the lynx's primary prey (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Cat Specialist Group 2002). In Europe, the lynx's preferred diet includes roe deer and chamois. Lynx will also take larger ungulates such as red deer, moose, or wild boar occasionally. Where ungulates are not available, birds, hares and rodents form important prey. In Norway, Sweden and Finland, lynx also kill significant numbers of semi-domesticated reindeer. Depredation on sheep is also a problem in some countries.;;Lynx are vulnerable to destruction of their ungulate prey base. Hunting pressure may also play a role in lynx population declines. Habitat destruction through clear-cutting can have a negative effect on lynx abundance. There is no information beyond harvest reports on which to base an assessment of the biological impact of commercial trapping for furs, and thus its significance as a threat is difficult to judge (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Cat Specialist Group 2002). The lynx's disappearance in lowland Europe was due to human persecution, deforestation, loss of prey species, expansion of agriculture and an increase in human populations. Although the lynx is not endangered, these threats still affect it today throughout Europe. Habitat loss, loss of prey due to logging and hunting, and human population pressures have serious negative impacts. Humans still present a major threat to the lynx, particularly to small or reintroduced populations. These groups can be devastated by traffic accidents or by unsustainable hunting and poaching. In Norway in 1998, licensed hunters killed 112 lynxes out of a total population of just 400-500. This scale of hunting may be unsustainable, particularly when compounded by illegal hunting. Threats to specific European populations are detailed below:1. JuraIllegal killing, traffic accidents, limited dispersal.2. Vosges-Palatinian.Illegal killing in the Vosges Mts., in general small population size with a rather limited potential to expand.3. Alpine.Threats include illegal killing, infrastructure development (especially road constructions), vehicle and train collisions, and limited dispersal. A potential threat for the population in the Alps is the narrow genetic base: all of the relatively few founder animals came from the same region and some of them were probably closely related. First genetic analysis indicated that the Alpine population has a reduced allelic diversity compared to the Carpathian source population, and that it has today the smallest level of heterozygosity of all European lynx populations.4. Bohemian-Bavarian.Illegal killing, habitat fragmentation due to road constructions.5. Dinaric.Legal and illegal shooting, collisions with vehicles/trains, limited prey base.6. Carpathian.Potentially illegal killing and habitat fragmentation due to infrastructure developments and wood cutting.7. Scandinavian.Illegal killing, potentially legal harvest.8. Karelian.Potentially harvest.9. Baltic.Population fragmentation (in the south-west of the range), potentially illegal killing.10. Balkan.Small population number, limited prey base and habitat degradation (especially in Albania), probably illegal killing.
M105;Lynx_pardinus;The Iberian lynx occurs in Mediterranean woodland and maquis thicket. It favours a mosaic of dense scrub for shelter and open pasture for hunting rabbits (ICONA 1992). Palomares et al. (1991) examined habitat preferences of lynx in the Coto Doñana area of south-western Spain, including the national park and environs. In the park, radiotelemetry showed that more than 90% of daytime resting spots used by lynx were located in thick heather scrub (Beltrán et al. 1987). The Iberian lynx is a specialised feeder, with rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) accounting for 80-100 per cent of its diet. Other species occasionally taken include rodents, hares, partridges, ducks, geese, juvenile deer, and fallow deer, but these do not form an important part of the lynx's diet. Lynx often kill other carnivore species, including those regarded as pests by humans, such as feral cats and foxes, but do not eat them. The lynx's highly specialised diet makes it a naturally vulnerable species and the rapid decline in rabbit populations since the 1950s has had a direct impact on lynx numbers (IUCN 2007).;Lynx were generally absent from cropland and exotic tree plantations (eucalyptus and pine), where rabbits were also scarce. ;The Iberian Lynx is a naturally vulnerable species because of its dependence on only one prey species, the rabbit, and its narrow habitat spectrum. The dramatic decline in rabbit populations, caused by habitat changes and myxomatosis since the 1950s and Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD) since the late 1980s, has therefore had a direct impact on lynx numbers. Over-hunting of rabbits and other human activities have further compounded the problems of prey scarcity. In recent years, prey scarcity has been compounded by high rates of non-natural mortality and habitat destruction and fragmentation. Habitat destruction, deterioration and alteration have impacted negatively on the lynx for centuries. Notable examples since the middle of the 20th century include the planting of Mediterranean scrublands with pines and eucalyptus and more recently the over stocking of deer and livestock on private estates and the opening up of roads and forest tracks in previously remote areas. The lynx's preferred habitat mosaic has also suffered at the hands of afforestation and scrub clearance schemes, road building, dam construction, and the building of holiday homes. New infrastructure projects continued to fragment lynx populations and created new barriers in corridor areas between the remaining populations in the 1960s. More than forty separate lynx populations in Spain and Portugal appear to have collapsed since the early 1980s. WWF Spain/Adena has identified 53 different public works that will affect important areas for the Iberian lynx. Heavier and faster traffic is also taking an unacceptably high toll on lynx each year as juveniles venture away from their areas of birth in search of new habitats. This high mortality has been an important factor in the decline of the species, particularly in the areas surrounding Doñana National Park. The Iberian Lynx received protection against hunting in the early 1970s and since then hunting has dropped off. However, some lynxes are still shot and killed in traps and snares set for smaller predators, particularly on commercial hunting and shooting estates (IUCN 2007).
M78;Felis_chaus;The jungle cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with closed forest, but rather with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments. It is able to satisfy these requirements in a variety of habitats, from desert to scrub woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).;;Jungle cats do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Thousands of jungle cat furs have been confiscated in illegal trade in India (Mukherjee 1998). In Europe, population and range declines since the 1960s have been attributed to illegal hunting and artificial landscape change.
M80;Felis_silvestris;"European wildcats are primarily associated with forest and are found in highest numbers in broad-leaved or mixed forests with low densities of humans. They are also found in Mediterranean maquis scrubland, riparian forest, marsh boundaries and along sea coasts. . As with other wildcats, rodents are the staple of the diet of European wildcats across much of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Biro et al. 2005) However, rabbits are a major prey where they occur (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lozano et al. 2006). Birds (both passerine and ground-dwelling) are of secondary importance (Biro et al. 2005). The composition of the diet shows only minor seasonal variations: rabbits or rodents are the major year-round food items. In Italy, historical (1968-1983) and recent (1994-2004) diets of wildcats show highly significant differences in composition, with an overwhelming occurrence of arthropods, reptiles and murines in the most recent period; the change appeared to be directly correlated to the expansion of wood vegetation and growth of atmospheric temperature over the last twenty years (Ragni 2006). Wildcats will also scavenge food and cache their kills, especially in winter (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The overlap in trophic niche between wildcats and feral domestic cats is large (Biro et al. 2005), indicating the potential for competition between these two taxa. Age at sexual maturity is 10-12 months for females and 9-10 months for males, interbirth interval is typically one year (although females may exceptionally breed twice in a year if the first litter is lost), and longevity is exceptionally up to 15 years, but more typically up to 5-6 years  (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Macdonald et al. 2004).";Areas of intensive cultivation are avoided (Nowell and Jackson 1996);"Habitat loss and persecution by humans caused the dramatic decline of this species in Europe in the 18th to mid 20th centuries. Today, the main threats are hybridization, disease transmission, and competition with feral domestic cats. There is ongoing habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation in some areas (e.g., Mediterranean bushland); although in some other parts of Europe forest cover is increasing as a result of abandonment of extensive agricultural land. The fact that wildcats have failed to recover across much of their former European range, despite decades of strict legal protection, indicates that although persecution has largely ceased, other factors are now limiting populations of this species.European wildcats suffer from hybridization with domestic cats, which descend from African wildcats. The process of domestication began thousands of years ago in North Africa and Southwest Asia, and domestic cats are now found in large numbers throughout the world, living in peoples' homes as well as feral in the wild. Feral cats compete with wildcats for prey and space, and there is also interbreeding or hybridization, which is leading to a strong decline in genetically pure wildcats in some areas. There is also a high potential for disease transmission between domestic cats and wildcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Fromont et al. 1998, Daniels et al. 1999), with some infections being maintained permanently in wildcat populations by transmission from domestic cats, when otherwise the diseases would die out (Fromont et al. 1998). A further risk is presented by the selective resistance of silvestris x catus  hybrids to viral disease infection (Ragni and Possenti 1991, Ragni 1993). Other threats include significant human-caused mortality, especially road kills (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lüps et al. 2002, Schulenberg 2005). The species is still considered a pest in Scotland and is illegally persecuted. Predator control measures in a number of European countries may result in this species being killed as bycatch. In Europe at least, the species has never been commercially exploited for its fur (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Introduced feral domestic cats cause serious harm to native species in many parts of the world, and there have been suggestions that virus-vectored immunocontraception should be developed as a control method (Courchamp and Cornell 2000). Any such development should take into account potential risks to wildcats. In recent years there have been a number of cases of people taking young wildcats from the wild in the mistaken belief that they would make good pets (8 cases in two years in two areas in Germany, and another cat that was introduced from France into the Netherlands: Canters et al. 2005, Simon et al. 2005)."
M88;Herpestes_ichneumon;Mainly associated with habitats with understorey vegetation in coastal, lacustrine and riparian (streams, rivers, marsh, swamps) habitats (Palomares in press). . In tropical Africa, the Egyptian mongoose occurs where there are termitaries, which Kingdon (1977) suggested could satisfy a need for secure shelter. In Europe, “it is found in Mediterranean maquis, with a clear preference for humid and riparian habitats (Delibes 1999).” Egyptian mongooses have home ranges of about 3 square kilometers, and are diurnal and omnivorous (Delibes 1999).;This species avoids humid forests and extreme deserts (Delibes 1999, Palomares in press);"There are no major threats to this species. Incidental poisoning by rodenticides is a localized threat, and trapping with boxes is legal in Portugal (F. Palomares pers. comm. 2007). Deliberate illegal poisoning of carnivores sometimes occurs (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006). “It is considered a pest by hunters, because of its presumed impact on small game species"" (Delibes 1999). The range of this species in south-western Europe has experienced reductions due to increased agricultural production, yet increases in range have also occurred due to the reduction of its natural predators (Delibes 1999)."
M86;Gulo_gulo;Wolverines inhabit a variety of habitats in the alpine, tundra, taiga, and boreal forest zones. They are found in coniferous, mixed, and deciduous woodlands, bogs, and open mountain and tundra habitats. Sometimes known as “hyaenas of the north”, wolverines have evolved to scavenge from the kills of wild ungulates abandoned by more efficient predators such as wolves and lynx, as well as victims of accidents and disease. However, wolverines also prey on hares, rodents and occasionally animals as large as moose given certain snow conditions. They can also prey heavily on domestic sheep and semidomesticated reindeer. The wolverine has vast home-ranges (Landa et al. 1998a) and good dispersal abilities. Faecal DNA sampling has detected dispersal distances of more than 500 kilometres (Flagstad 2005, Flagstad et al. 2006).;;Wolverines are scarce in Europe today. Their continued survival is threatened due to their small and fragmented distribution, and the potential for their future survival may be weakened by the likelihood of low genetic diversity. Habitat loss per se is not a substantial threat to wolverine conservation. Large areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland are still covered by forests and mountains that offer a suitable prey base and habitat for wolverines. The problem is that these are not wilderness areas, and wolverines come into conflict with a low, but crucial, number of human land uses. The fact that there are no large areas within their distribution where there is no conflict potential with sheep or semidomestic reindeer means that human tolerance for wolverines is low. This results in a difficult situation for wildlife managers who are forced to try and balance wolverine conservation with the conflicts they create with livestock. In Norway, farmers no longer use traditional sheep-herding methods that once deterred depredation, so wolverines are often controlled in an effort to protect livestock. Poaching also occurs. In Russia, overharvesting and declines in key prey species are major threats.1. Scandinavian wolverine populationHigh levels of depredation on domestic sheep in Norway, and on semi-domestic reindeer in Norway, Sweden and Finland, generate large conflicts. These lead to pressure for population reduction through both legal and illegal killing. Finding ways to reduce depredation on sheep is crucial. It is unclear if the existing levels of harvest, especially in Norway, are sustainable. With respect to depredation on semi-domestic reindeer solutions are harder to find as wolverines depend heavily on semi-domestic reindeer for food.2. Karelian wolverine populationThe Russian economic depression during the 1990s is believed to have led to widespread poaching of ungulate game species. Furthermore, there has been a reduction of the semi-domestic reindeer herding industry due to large calf/breeding losses. This is believed to have indirectly negatively affected wolverine populations in western Russia. The wolverine's main prey base (wild and domestic reindeer) became less abundant and the population has faced a decrease in numbers and distribution during the last decades.
M103;Lutra_lutra;"It is known from a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including highland and lowland lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and coastal areas. It is very adaptable, using saltwater as well as freshwater habitats, and even sewerage systems in urban areas. In most parts of its range otter distribution is correlated with presence of riverbank vegetation. Otters in different regions may depend upon different features of the habitat, but the important component of otter habitat, for breeding purposes, is the presence of holes in the river bank, including cavities among tree roots, piles of rock, wood or debris. Their distribution in coastal areas is strongly correlated with the presence of freshwater. The location of breeding holts is not confined to river banks; there is evidence to indicate that sometimes the species breeds well away from water and the pups are moved to holts on the river banks once they are a few months old (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004).";The Eurasian otter avoids deep water. ;The aquatic habitats of otters are extremely vulnerable to man-made changes. Canalisation of rivers, removal of bank side vegetation, dam construction, abstraction of water for irrigation, draining of wetlands, agricultural activities and associated man-made impacts on aquatic systems are all unfavourable to otter populations. Pollution is major threat to the otters in western and central Europe, the main pollutants posing a danger to otters are the organochlorines dieldrin (HEOD) and DDT/DDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the heavy metal mercury. Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Acidification of rivers and lakes results in the decline of fish biomass and reduces the food resources of the otters. The same effects are known to result from organic pollution by nitrate fertilisers, untreated sewage, or farm slurry. In addition, major causes of mortality from several countries are drowning, road kills, and poaching. Fyke nets set for eels and other fish as well as creels set for marine crustaceans are very attractive to otters, and many that try to enter these traps are entangled and drowned. A further potential threat is strangulation by transparent, monofilament drift net. A potential risk comes from traps designed to kill other species, especially underwater cages constructed to drown muskrats. Illegal hunting is still a problem in many parts of their distribution range. In several European countries political pressure especially by fishermen has resulted in granting of licenses for killing otters (Reuther and Hilton-Taylor 2004). Illegal killing for the trade of pelts is on the increase in Ukraine and Danube Delta, and probably in the eastern parts of its global range (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006).
M110;Martes_foina;The stone marten prefers more open areas than other martens (Sachhi and Meriggi 1995). Its habitat preferences vary in different parts of its range. It is typically found in deciduous forest, forest edge, and open rocky hillsides (sometimes above the tree line). However, in Switzerland, Austria, north-east France, and southern Germany, it is very common in suburban and urban areas, often building its nest in house attics, outhouses, barns, garages, or even car engine spaces. In some areas they are common in towns and rare in woods. Commensal beech martens may cause damage to roofs, insulation, and electrical wiring and pipes in houses and cars (Broekhuizen 1999).;;"This species has no major threats. It is sometimes persecuted as a pest. The species is hunted for its fur in India and Russia; and is also hunted for food in some parts of its global range (not in Europe)."
M111;Martes_martes;It inhabits deciduous, mixed, and coniferous woodlands, as well as scrub. Optimal habitat appears to be woodlands with an incomplete canopy and dense understorey vegetation. Pine martens have a predominantly carnivorous diet, consuming voles, mice, squirrels, rabbits, birds, and amphibians. Carrion is a major food source in the winter. Bee nests, mushrooms, and berries are also sometimes eaten. Solitary, but not highly territorial. The home ranges very often overlap partially or even totally. Female may mate with several males while on heat. There is delayed implantation after 165-210 days. In the eastern parts of distribution area (Ural Mts) it can hybridize with sympatrically distributed sable M. zibellina (A. Abramov pers. comm. 2006).;;Threats to the pine marten include unsustainable hunting and trapping, incidental poisoning, and the loss and fragmentation of woodland habitats. The marten is still hunted and trapped for its fur in some parts of its range. Its decline in Britain was due to persecution, and the species is still subject to persecution even in some countries in which it is protected. Efforts to control other carnivore species sometimes result in pine marten deaths.
M165;Mustela_lutreola;European mink have specialised habitat requirements. They are semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of lakeshores, rivers, streams and marshlands, and are rarely found more than 100 meters away from fresh water. They forage at night, hunting both on land and in water for a wide range of animal prey including small mammals, birds, frogs, molluscs, crabs, fish and insects (Youngman 1990, Maran 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Females become mature at 19 months (Youngman 1990).;;Habitat loss and degradation is a serious threat to the European mink. Ongoing destruction and degradation of freshwater and associated terrestrial habitats is caused by by inter alia hydroelectric developments, channelisation and water pollution. Accidental trapping is also a threat, even though the fur of the European mink is less valuable than that of the American mink Neovison vison. In France, secondary poisoning and trapping of European mink has occurred as a result of efforts to control coypu (Myocastor coypus) and small carnivores (e.g. polecat). Accidental mortality through vehicle collisions is a problem in some areas, and small remnant populations may be driven extinct by threats such as predation by feral dogs and accidental mortality in fish traps (T. Maran pers. comm. 2006). Competition and direct aggression from the American mink is a further threat to depleted remnant populations (Maran 1999). The Aleutian disease could also have an impact, but diseased animals have not yet been found. In Spain and France, hybridization with Mustela putorius may be a threat (Davidson et al. 2000).
M166;Mustela_nivalis;Weasels tolerate a wide range of habitats, including forests, farmlands and cultivated fields, grassy fields and meadows, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, alpine meadows and forests, scrub, steppe and semi-deserts, prairies, and coastal dunes (Sheffield and King 1994, Pulliainen 1999). This species is a specialist predator of small mammals (especially rodents), although it will also occasionally feed on birds eggs, lizards, frogs, salamanders, fish, worms, and carrion (Sheffield and King 1994). Habitat selection is usually determined by local distribution of rodents. They prefer dense, rank grassland where microtines (voles and lemmings) are abundant (R. McDonald pers. comm. 2006).;Foraging individuals avoid open spaces, where they are most vulnerable to predation by raptors (Sheffield and King 1994). ;Threats include incidental poisoning with rodenticides (Sheffield and King 1994) and persecution. The weasel prefers open agricultural habitats, which are declining owing to changes in agricultural practices (rural abandonment) in parts of Europe, as open fields undergo succession.
M167;Mustela_putorius;"A generalist, it is found in almost every type of lowland habitat. It is often found in lowland woods in riparian zones, and in areas close to farms and villages in the winter; but it also uses wooded steppe, sand dunes, marshes and river valleys, agricultural land, forest edge and mosaic habitats (Birks 1999, Cabral et al. 2005). It feeds on live rodents (voles, mice, hamsters) and other vertebrates, also sometimes on invertebrates and carrion. In wetland areas it often feeds on amphibians (Birks 1999)."; Mountainous areas are avoided.;In western and central Europe, it was formerly widely hunted for sport and fur and persecuted as a pest, although this threat has become less serious as the species is now protected in a number of range states and rates of hunting have greatly reduced (Birks 1999). Accidental mortality in car collisions and via secondary rodenticide poisoning is a problem (Birks 1999, Battersby 2005). Declines in prey species, e.g. hamsters (Nechay 2000) and rabbits in southern Iberia (Cabral et al. 2005) may contributing to declines in parts of the range. In European Russia, the species is commonly hunted (A. Abramov pers. comm. 2006). Hybridisation with the ferret is a possible threat in the United Kingdom (Battersby 2005). Possible competition with the American mink may also be a problem. In Morocco, the species may be captured in some areas for hunting.
M168;Mustela_sibirica;The species occurs in primary and secondary deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, as well as open areas with small patches of forest enclaves and forest steppe. It is also found along river valleys. It feeds on small mammals, such as voles, squirrels, mice and pikas, amphibians, fish, and carrion, and occasionally on vegetative matter (e.g. pine nuts) (Global Mammal Assessment Small Carnivore Workshop 2006).;;There are no major threats known to this species (Global Mammal Assessment Small Carnivore Workshop 2006). It is legally hunted in Russia for its fur (A. Abramov pers. comm. 2006).
M293;Vormela_peregusna;It inhabits desert, semi-desert and steppe habitats. It is a specialized predator, feeding mainly on desert and steppe rodents such as gerbils, ground squirrels, and birds. It is the most fossorial of all weasels.;;The major threat to this species is the loss of natural steppe and desert habitats. Steppe habitats are declining in Europe as they are converted to cultivated farmland. Secondary poisoning by rodenticides may also be a threat, as are population declines in key prey species (a number of steppe rodent species are declining in Europe). In China, desertification is the major threat to the species.
M112;Martes_zibellina;The species is primarily found in dense coniferous forests, but can tolerate other types of forests. It feeds on small rodents, voles, squirrels, pikas, doves and berries. For this species in the Ob region of Russia, Monakhov (2001) found that young animals tended to live near floodplains (lowland forest), while adult animals lived on watersheds (upland forest).;;This species is still commercially hunted, and logging of primary dense coniferous habitat in Siberia and the Far East is a threat. The species is heavily farmed for fur (A. Abramov pers. comm. 2006). In Japan, introduced Japanese marten Martes melampus can be a competitor of the endemic subspecies Martes zibellina brachyura (T. Murakami pers. comm. 2006).
M114;Meles_meles;It prefers deciduous woods with clearings, or open pastureland with small patches of woodland. It is also found in mixed and coniferous woodland, scrub, suburban areas and urban parks (Prigioni 1999). It is an opportunistic forager with an omnivorous diet, including fruit, nuts, bulbs, tubers, acorns, and cereal crops. It also consumes a variety of invertebrates (especially earthworms), wasp and bee nests, birds' eggs, carrion, and live vertebrate prey such as hedgehogs, moles, and rabbits. In the northern parts of its range the species hibernates during the winter months. The home ranges of this species in Finland are very large, with a mean of about 15 km2 (Kauhala et al. 2006), and their social system is peculiar, with large overlapping home ranges without any communal den (K. Kauhala in litt. 2006). In Finland, it does not reproduce every year, and the litter size is small (Kauhala et al. 2006).;;It is sometimes persecuted as a pest. In central Europe the population was formerly severely reduced by rabies, but that threat has now decreased with rabies controls. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the species is associated with bovine TB, which is used as a pretext to eradicate the species. During hunting for foxes or raccoons the badger is often killed as bycatch. In the Russian Federation the species is sometimes hunted for its meat and fat which is used as a medicine. The species is sensitive to habitat fragmentation and the size of the remaining patch is important for the continued survival of the species. In Germany, the species is hunted annually. It is possible that the introduced raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) competes with the badger in parts of its range, and a project in Finland is looking into this possible threat (K. Kauhala in litt. 2006). Badgers are heavily hunted in Finland, the annual harvest has increased in recent years, being about 10,000 badgers now (K. Kauhala in litt. 2006). The hunting season in Finland is the whole year, with the exception of females with young being protected in May, June, and July (K. Kauhala in litt. 2006).
M163;Mustela_erminea;Stoats occupy a wide range of habitats. They are often found in successional or forest-edge habitats, in scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks that have high densities of small mammals, especially Microtus and Arvicola species (King 1983). Pulliainen (1999) states that coniferous and mixed woodlands are preferred, but that many other habitats are used including tundra and the summits of fells and mountains.  This species is a specialist predator of small mammals, but will occasionally feed on fruit, earthworms, insects, eggs, and birds (King 1983). Its local distribution is typically related to that of small rodents and lagomorphs (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999). Estimates for home range size range from 4 to 200 hectares for males, most often falling between 10 to 40 hectares (King 1983).;Dense forests and deserts are avoided (King 1983).;In the Iberian Peninsula the species is dependent on two Arvicola species, and these are declining, so loss of prey base may be a threat (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Habitat loss (e.g. as a result of urbanization: Pulliainen 1999) is also a problem in parts of the range. The species is commonly hunted in Russia, where there is also a limited fur trade (R. McDonald pers. comm. 2006). In western and central Europe, the stoat was frequently hunted for its white winter fur up until at least the 1930s (with c.30,000 pelts sold in Finland alone during that decade) (Pulliainen 1999). Availability of prey is the principal factor controlling population density (King 1983, Pulliainen 1999), but disease, parasites and other pressures can also contribute.
M164;Mustela_eversmanii;It inhabits a variety of relatively dry habitats including steppes, semi-deserts, pastures, and cultivated fields (Wolsan 1999). Its diet consists mainly of rodents, including sousliks, marmots, hamsters, pikas, gerbils and voles. It  is primarily nocturnal.;avoids forests, and;In western Europe it is seldom intentionally hunted (although it may be taken as bycatch) but is heavily impacted by persecution (EMA Workshop 2006). However in at least parts of its range (e.g. Russia) it is commonly hunted for its fur.
M291;Ursus_maritimus;Polar bears occur at low densities throughout their range and are most abundant in shallow water areas near shore or where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity near ice areas associated with open water, polynyas or lead systems. Polar bears are not as abundant in the high central arctic over deeper waters of the polar basin. Seasonally, in the summer open water season in the Canadian arctic islands and Svalbard, and in recent years during the fall in northern Alaska and Russian Chukotka, polar bears may be found on land in higher densities. Breeding occurs in March to May, implantation is delayed until autumn, and birth is generally thought to occur from late November to mid-January. Although some cubs are born in earth dens, most births occur in snow dens that may be occupied between 5-6 months during the maternal event. In Alaska the maternal dens are located on the offshore sea ice. Only pregnant female polar bears den for this protracted period of time, during which time they rely on fat stores for energy and sustenance. The average litter size is less than two. Cubs are dependent upon mothers until after the start of their third year of life. Age of first reproduction is normally 5-6 years for females. These factors contribute to the low reproductive potential for the species (Schliebe et al. 2006).;;"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment have both predicted that the Arctic is extremely vulnerable to projected climate change. Polar bears will likely be shifted pole-ward if the sea ice retreats. According to new scenarios presented by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre and others, the polar ice cap will disappear almost entirely during summer in the next 100 years. The winter ice over the continental shelf in the European Arctic will probably also disappear (Furevik et al. 2002). The increasing changes in the sea ice that affect access to prey will have a negative effect on the bears. With less food, polar bears will fail to reproduce more often and give birth to smaller young that have higher mortality rates. Polar bears may be forced on shore for extended periods and rely on fat reserves deposited the previous spring for survival. In such a situation they will be increasingly vulnerable to unregulated hunting. If these periods become excessively long, mortality will increase. Sea ice is also used for access to den areas and if ice patterns change, existing den areas may be unreachable. Warmer temperatures and higher winds may reduce ice thickness and increase ice drift. Because polar bears must walk against the moving ice (like walking the wrong way on an escalator) increased ice movements will increase energy use and reduce growth and reproduction (Schliebe et al. 2006). Polar bears are the apex predator and are exposed to high levels of pollutants that are magnified with each step higher in the food web. A key characteristic of the pollutants is that they tend to persist in the environment and resist degradation. Many of the organochlorine pollutants are lipophilic or ""fat loving"" and bond tightly to fat molecules. Polar bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of polar bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Schliebe et al. 2006). Certain areas of the Arctic, such as north-east Greenland, the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea, have higher levels of pollutants. Based on studies in other species, it is reasonable to believe that the pollutant load of polar bears in some areas are negatively affecting the immune system, hormone regulation, growth patterns, reproduction, and survival rates of polar bears (Derocher et al. 2002). Recent studies have suggested that the immune system is weaker in polar bears with higher levels of PCBs. A major concern with polar bears pertains to their reproductive system. There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption. Further, female polar bears are food deprived during gestation their pollution loads increase because as they use their fat stores, where pollutants are stored, for energy. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk, the cubs are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Schliebe et al. 2006). Recent studies have indicated that high loads of organochlorines may cause reduction in the size of sexual organs of polar bears in certain areas, thus theoretically impairing reproduction (Sonne et al. 2006).Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide range of threats to polar bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions (Derocher et al. 2002). It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both polar bears and their main prey (ringed and bearded seals) being directly exposed to oil. Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Other studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to disturbance at maternity den sites. Disturbance could occur both when a pregnant female is selecting a den site and during the winter-spring after the cubs are born. If exploration or development occurred sufficiently close to a den, the mother may abandon the den prematurely or abandon her offspring (Schliebe et al. 2006)."
M290;Ursus_arctos;"The original distribution of the brown bear in Europe illustrates its adaptability to different environmental conditions. With little or no human interference, brown bears occupied not only forests, but also steppes and tundra. Today, most of the bear' s former range is no longer suitable habitat due to human habitat alteration and human presence. Components of habitat can be grouped into three main categories: food, escape cover, and den sites. Bear movements and habitat use are strongly affected by availability of food. Furthermore, population density is positively associated with food availability. Areas with a high availability of preferred foods, such as berries, fruits, hard mast, colonial Hymenoptera, and ungulates, are of special importance to brown bears.1. CantabrianThe Cantabrian population inhabits the Cantabrian Mountains, which are partly covered with mixed deciduous forest.2. PyreneesMixed forests and pastures, depending on slope and elevation. 3. AlpsHabitat is predominately Alpine with steep slopes covered mostly by conifers. Human settlements and infrastructure in the valleys contribute to habitat fragmentation. 4. Appenine MountainsMountain habitat in the central Appenines; partly covered by deciduous forest (dominated by beech). 5. Dinara-PindosThe landscape is mountainous, dominated by mixed beech and spruce forest.6. CarpathianThe habitat is mainly the mixed forests in the Carpathian Mountain range. 7. BalkanMostly mountains with deciduous secondary forests.8. ScandinaviaThe habitat is dominated by intensively exploited boreal forest. 9. Northeastern EuropeThe habitat is dominated by intensively exploited boreal forest.";;Bears have a low reproductive rate and are vulnerable to human-related mortality. They require large habitats that make them vulnerable to changes in land use. In Eastern Europe, land use once under centralised state administration has reverted to private ownership, often with no knowledge of wildlife management. Land use developments have tended to follow western examples with more intensive use of productive areas. The best bear habitat has already disappeared in Europe through logging and forest clearance. The planting of exotic conifers has seriously altered local ecosystems in some places. Habitat fragmentation, particularly as a result of road construction, presents serious problems for a species requiring such large areas. Mortality caused by high-speed road and rail networks through bear habitat is a major threat in some areas including Greece and Croatia. Poaching remains a threat to many, but not all populations, and takes place irrespective of population size. Females with cubs, as well as males, are liable to be killed. Poaching has probably worsened in countries such as Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Yugoslav Federation, and FYR Macedonia as a result of declining economic and social conditions. Poaching in Russia, to supply the lucrative market for bear parts in Asian countries, is a particular problem. Five very small, isolated bear populations in southern and western Europe (located in France, Spain and Italy), are highly threatened by their small population size. They could easily become extinct as a result of random fluctuations.1. CantabrianThe main pressure is the loss of adult individuals due to human induced mortality. 2. PyreneesThe main pressure is the loss of adult individuals due to killing by humans. 3. AlpsDamages done by bears have the potential to reduce the public acceptance of this species, and of trouble-making individuals in particular. Intensive management of all bear related problems is under way. Despite the constant increase of the Central Italian nucleus, the limited numbers of individuals characterizing all the alpine nuclei show that all these are Critically Endangered. The loss of more than 15 bears from the central Austrian bear population and 2 dispersers from Italy suggest an unnatural high mortality rate of bears in the Alps. Unfortunately, illegal removals seems to be the most likely explanation.4. Appenine MountainsThe main pressure is the loss of adult individuals due to human induced mortality. The population is critically endangered. The bear population has been totally isolated for over a century, thus there may be genetic problems.5. Dinara-PindosPolitical instability and the lack of financial instruments represent a pressure in the central part of the range. 6. CarpathianThe socio-economic developments in Romania have an influence on bear population on medium and long term and it is considered that the Romanian bear population is vulnerable. 7. BalkanPresently in Bulgaria there is liberal (poorly functioning) system of declaring the problem individuals assigned for removal, as well as poorly controlled poaching. 8. ScandinaviaThe major pressure in Norway is related to damages on unguarded free-ranging sheep. 9. Northeastern EuropeDue to a large total size and large area the population is in favorable conservation status.
M83;Genetta_genetta;The genet tends to prefer all types of wooded habitats (deciduous and evergreen), where it is often associated with rivers and brooks, but it is a generalist and can be found in other habitats where there is suitable prey. may occur even in small fragments of woodland in farmland or near villages, ). The common genet is not uncommonly found in proximity to people and human buildings (e.g. Admasu et al. 2004). It feeds mainly on small mammals, but will also take birds, other small vertebrates, insects, and fruit (Delibes and Gaubert in press).; It avoids open habitats, but. and usually is absent from rainforests, dense woodlands and woodland-moist savannah mosaics (e.g. miombo woodland in Angola) (Delibes and Gaubert in press;There are no major threats. They are occasionally eaten by people in some localities, and body parts are used for medicinal purposes while skins may be used for the manufacture of karosses in southern Africa (Delibes and Gaubert in press). In Europe, the genet used to be trapped for its fur (Delibes 1999). In Portugal genets are illegally killed in predator trapping for hunting management. On Ibiza, the genet is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of habitat caused by urbanization and infrastructure and tourism development. The ability of genets to live close to humans and their domestic animals could have implications for disease transmission (Admasu et al. 2004).
M231;Rupicapra_pyrenaica;"The species is found in alpine meadows, rocky areas, and the forested valleys and lower slopes in mountainous regions. This species generally stays above 1,800 meters in alpine meadows during the warmer months of the year (Nowak, 1983). These animals make altitudinal migrations from the forests in the valleys to the more open alpine meadows (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). In late fall and winter they have been known to enter lands below 1,100 meters, while usually staying on steep slopes. In recent years some populations have started to permanently inhabit forest (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999; Herrero pers. comm. 2006).";, and rarely if ever occur in forested areas (Nowak, 1983);"The threats to the species vary in different parts of its range. In Italy, subspecies ornata might be vulnerable to many factors because the total number is small, there are only three subpopulations, and genetic variability is very low (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006). Space and food competition with livestock, especially domestic caprins, seem to be the main limiting factors for ornata . Some poaching occurs, but does not seem to impair the viability of the chamois population in Abruzzo National Park. There are currently no problems with disease for the Italian subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). However, in France and Spain disease is currently the most important threat. Pestivirus appeared in the Pyrenean subspecies in c. 2004, and sarcoptic mange outbreaks periodically cause local declines in the Cantabrian subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In Spain and the Pyrenees, chamois coexist with domestic livestock, but there do not appear to be problems with competition; indeed in the Pyrenees the presence of domestic livestock is considered to benefit the chamois, via maintenance of young and good quality forage, which increases the carrying capacity (J. Berducou pers. comm. 2006). Most Pyrenean and Cantabrian populations are hunted (with the exception of within National Parks). Chamois is a major game species in Spain and is important socially and economically as a source of rural livelihoods. Hunting is carefully managed and revenue from hunting is returned to the local community. In Spain, regional governments set quotas, and hunting is not at an unsustainable level (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In France, hunting is essentially a recreational and non-profit leisure activity, and average annual quotas are under 10% of censused populations. This is sustainable, with only a few local exceptions (C. Berducou pers. comm. 2006)."
M203;Ovis_aries;In Europe, the species inhabits Mediterranean maquis (shrubland), rocky areas, and open coniferous forest and green oak forest. Mouflon are hunted for trophies and meat.; It is absent from dense woodland (Röhrs 1999).;Hunting is the most important threat, although competition and crossbreeding with domestic sheep are also threats (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006). However, these are not considered to endanger the species at present.
M37;Capra_pyrenaica;It occurs in rocky habitats. Even small rocky patches in arable farmland and on the coast may be used, although cliffs and screes interspersed with scrub or pine trees are the most typical habitats. It often lives in very close proximity to humans, and is a familiar and popular species. It disperses readily and can rapidly colonise new areas if appropriate habitat is available. It is an important trophy-hunting species, with some trophy prices exceeding EUR 2,000 (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Hunting can be an important source of revenue to local communities in rural areas. The species can sometimes be an agricultural pest, causing damage to almond trees (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006).;;"No threats are causing population or range declines at present - indeed the species is expanding. However, alteration and fragmentation of habitats (through agriculture, forestry, fires, and infrastructure development) may impact upon certain Capra pyrenaica populations, and competition with the introduced the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) might become a conservation problem in the near future (Cabral et al. 2005, J. M. Pérez pers. comm. 2006). The aoudad was introduced during the 1970s in southeastern Spain, and recently an important range expansion of this exotic ungulate has been reported (Cassinello et al. 2004); competition between these two ungulate species can be expected. The impact of hunting (predominantly for trophies) has not been scientifically assessed (J. M. Pérez pers. comm. 2006), but the poaching of large dominant males might alter gene flow (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). However, hunting levels are broadly under control. Outbreaks of mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) occur sporadically and have caused at least one major population crash (Shackleton 1997, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Wild goats are occasionally killed by accident during wild boar hunting-drives with dogs (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Previously, the population was kept low by competition with domestic livestock, which restricted wild goats to marginal habitats. The causes of C. p. pyrenaica' s demise are unknown, but there are a number of hypotheses including competition for food with chamois, inbreeding depression, parasite infections from domestic livestock, climatic conditions, poaching, and low fertility due to plant secondary compounds (Shackleton 1997). The last remaining individual, a 13-year-old female, was killed by a falling tree."
M36;Capra_ibex;Alpine ibex typically inhabit open, rocky habitats at high altitude, above the tree line. Steep, south-facing slops with rugged topography and grassy vegetation are preferred. Below the tree line, at subalpine levels, ibex are only found in open, sunny woodland interspersed with rocky outcrops (Nievergelt and Zingg 1986, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). Ibex feed on alpine grasses, herbaceous plants and shrubs (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). This species is diurnal, but most active during the early morning and late afternoon. Living in montane pastures, they eat grasses and some woody plants. They migrate seasonally to different altitudes, spending the harsher winter months at medium elevations. The animals occur in maternal herds of 10-20 members, while males roam solitarily or in bachelor groups.  Females gestate for about 170 days, and usually carry one kid per pregnancy.  Females are sexually mature by 18 months, and males are mature at 2 years. The species lifespan is typically 10-14 years.;;Although the species is not considered threatened at present, there is concern regarding genetic diversity, the founder effect and minimum viable populations (Shackleton 1997, Maudet et al. 2002). Genetic variability in ibex populations is among the lowest reported from microsatellites in mammal species, and the Alpi Marittime–Mercantour population in particular has suffered from a severe genetic bottleneck associated with its reintroduction (Maudet et al. 2002). The ibex's distribution remains fragmented and many colonies are small and thus vulnerable to epizootics and stochastic events as well as inbreeding depression. Colonies with >60 individuals are believed to be viable as long as diseases (most importantly mange) do not affect them (Shackleton 1997, EMA Workshop 2006). Hybridization can be a threat where populations are small and sympatric with high densities of domestic goats, as is the case in Italy (Randi et al. 1990, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). High densities of domestic goats and sheep may also have a negative impact on the ibex through parasite and disease transmission and resource competition (Shackleton 1997, J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Appropriate habitat for the species may be decreasing, as the abandonment of traditional agriculture means that high-altitude alpine meadows are reverting to forest through natural succession (EMA Workshop 2006). Human disturbance as a result of increased tourism and recreation is suspected to be a general threat to mountain ungulates (Shackleton 1997). Alpine ibex are legally hunted in some areas (e.g. Bulgaria, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia), although hunting is completely prohibited in several range states (Shackleton 1997). Legal hunting is not considered a threat if it is properly planned and regulated, but poaching is a potential threat (Dupré et al. 2001).
M32;Capra_hircus_aegagrus;Agrimi inhabit mountainous areas, where there is a mixture of rocky outcrops or scree slopes and vegetation (shrubby maquis thickets or conifer forests). They tend to be found in relatively arid habitats, and are herbivorous, feeding on grasses, herbaceous plants and shrubs (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999).;;For the Cretan population, the greatest threat is hybridization with recently feral domestic goats that are common even within Samaria National Park. Other problems arise from increased road accessibility, which in turn increases tourism and poaching problems. In Majorca, hybridization with feral domestic goats is again the main threat (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).
M28;Bison_bonasus;"Optimal habitats for the European bison are deciduous and mixed forests, but the range should include about 20% of grassland habitats (meadows) (Pucek et al. 2004, K. Perzanowski pers. comm. 2006). In Białowieża Forest (Poland) they primarily forage in moist deciduous forests, and then in mixed coniferous forests (Krasińska et al. 1987, Krasiński and Krasińska 1994). Forest complexes with a mosaic-like forest type arrangement (such as Białowieża and Borecka Forests, Poland) are most favourable. In fresh deciduous forest, European bison find food throughout the vegetative season. In the Caucasus region, European bison prefer foothill forests; in summer, they feed on alpine meadows (Kazmin and Smirnov 1992, Kazmin et al. 1992). However, considerable plasticity of European bison with regard to food means they also forage in habitats where coniferous forests predominate (Krasiński et al. 1999). All European bison populations inhabit ranges that include open areas, such as mown meadows, deforested feeding glades covered with grass, clear cuts and young plantations up to 10 years old (Dzięciołowski 1991, Krasińska and Krasiński 1994, Krasiński et al. 1999). The attraction of open areas results from the fact that meadows and glades provide ungulates with much more food than the same area of the forest herb layer and food is more easily available there (Korochkina and Bunevich 1980, Kazmin et al. 1992). The species had an important role in the formation of the prehistoric European broad-leaf forest and forested steppe ecosystems (Pucek et al. 2004).";;"Habitat degradation and fragmentation due to agricultural activity, forest logging, and unlimited hunting and poaching were the primary reasons for the decrease and extinction of European bison populations. Pucek (1991) has summarised the history of their extinction. Among the primary reasons for the rapid decrease of the European bison population in Białowieża Primeval Forest at the beginning of 19th century was the over-population of deer species, and the drastic reduction of natural food resources for herbivores which resulted (Wróblewski 1927). During the period of World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917, conflict and heavy poaching exacted a severe toll on remaining populations (Pucek et al. 2004). Conflict and political instability continues to be a threat to the species in the Caucasus, where reintroduced free-living herds have suffered very severe losses (leading to extinctions) in recent years (Pucek et al. 2004). Other current threats include lack of appropriate habitat, fragmentation of populations (and concomitant loss of genetic diversity), inbreeding depression, disease, hybridization, and poaching. There is little space for a large herbivore such as the European bison in Europe's contemporary ecosystems, especially in the west. The most significant limit for the enlargement of European bison populations is human population density; forestry and agricultural activity is not a limiting factor. Fragmentation and isolation of free-ranging (and captive) herds result in little or no exchange of genetic material. Small isolated populations quickly lose their genetic heterogeneity and are more vulnerable to extinction (Franklin 1980). As yet, the opportunity to reconstruct a more compact geographic range to facilitate migration of bison between herds does not exist. As a consequence of passing a dramatic bottleneck (the current population descends from just 12 founder animals), the gene pool is limited and animals are highly inbred. The average inbreeding coefficient is very high compared to other large mammals, and is equal to 44% in the Lowland line and 26% in the Lowland-Caucasian line for individuals with a full pedigree (Olech 1998). The negative effects of inbreeding, manifested in the decline in reproduction rate, are more strongly pronounced in the Lowland-Caucasian line than in the Lowland line (Olech 1987, 1989, 1998). Inbreeding exerts a harmful effect on skeleton growth, particularly in females (Kobryńczuk 1985), and possibly lowers the resistance of bison to disease and pathologies.Diseases appearing in European bison populations can bring serious threats to the whole species. It is not certain whether the species has always shown a weak resistance to disease or if immunity has declined, due to limited genetic heterogeneity. The most important disease affects the male reproductive organs and is manifested in the inflammation of the penis and prepuce, leading to diphtheroid-necrotic lesions, diagnosed as balanoposthitis. This disease was discovered at the beginning of the 1980s in Białowieża Forest (Kita et al. 1995, Piusiński et al. 1997, Jakob et al. 2000); although similar symptoms had been reported earlier (Korochkina and Kochko 1982) in Russia and Ukraine (Krasochko et al. 1997). Despite many years of study, its pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated. Other diseases that are potentially major threats to herds include foot-and-mouth disease Aphte epizooticae (to which the species is known to be sensitive) (Podgurniak 1967), and tuberculosis (Żórawski and Lipiec 1997, Welz et al. 2005) .A particular problem concerning the management of extant populations of European bison is the existence of hybrid herds, especially European × American bison hybrids living in the Caucasus. Two free-living hybrid herds have been established in the Caucasus Mountains, in close proximity to reintroduced free-living herds of the pure blood Lowland-Caucasian line. There are fears that all these animals will crossbreed, creating a mixture of various genotypes. According to Russian authors, the distances between herds are not so great, but the configuration of mountain ridges and valleys make it impossible for contact between them. There are also two small semi-free herds of European × American bison hybrids in Toksove Forest Park (St Petersburg) and the Mordovia Wildlife Reserve (Pucek et al. 2004). Finally, poaching as a result of administrative disorders and a failure to enforce nature conservancy law threatens free-living herds of European bison in many countries."
M233;Saiga_tatarica;Inhabits arid steppes and semi-deserts. Prefers clay soil open spaces covered with grass . A migratory species with widely separated summer (northern) and winter (southern) ranges. Lives in large herds, usually up to thousand individuals. Heat is at the beginning of winter when males defend harems of females. Gives birth in April-May to two, more seldom to one calf.;and avoids rugged terrain as well as sandy areas;"Uncontrolled illegal hunting for horns (male horns are exported for the traditional Chinese medicine trade) and meat since the break-up of the former USSR has led to the catastrophic fall in numbers. Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has affected reproduction: recent research shows that heavily skewed sex ratios are resulting in reproductive collapse (Milner-Gulland et al. 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. Agricultural abandonment is a problem in some areas; cattle grazing formerly maintained the grassy species but land abandonment allows another species (Stippa sp.) to encroach, which the saiga cannot eat. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. Severe winters can cause mass mortality."
M232;Rupicapra_rupicapra;Alpine chamois inhabit steep, rocky areas in the mountains, utilising a variety of habitats including alpine meadows, open rocky areas, mixed broadleaf woodland, and coniferous woodland (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). They feed on grasses and herbs, and on the leaves of trees (Sägesser and Krapp 1986).;;Poaching and over-hunting may be a problem for the species in parts of its range, especially where it occurs outside protected areas and private hunting reserves (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Many of the less numerous subspecies (e.g. R. r. balcanica, R. r. cartusiana, and R. r. tatrica) are threatened by the deliberate introduction of subspecies from other geographic areas (especially R. r. rupicapra), leading to hybridisation and genetic swamping (Shackleton 1997). Human disturbance, particularly as a result of increased tourism and leisure activities in mountain areas, may also be a problem (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000). Competition with domestic livestock and introduced species such as the mouflon Ovis aries is a threat to the more vulnerable subspecies, although it is not considered to be a major problem for R. r. rupicapra. R. r. rupicapra does, however, suffer periodic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, causing local population declines (Shackleton 1997). In 2006 a new disease, pestivirus, was first recorded in this subspecies (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). In general, habitat loss is not a major threat to the species, as much of its range falls within protected areas. However, habitat loss may be a problem in some areas (e.g. for subspecies balcanica in Albania) (Shackleton 1997). Because its population is very small indeed, subspecies cartusiana is susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic demographic or environmental events (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006).
M39;Capreolus_pygargus;"Inhabits different types of deciduous and mixed forests and forest-steppes. In summer it is solitary whereas in winter it aggregates into groups of up to 20-30 individuals. During the seasonal nomadic period it forms herds of up to 500 individuals. Polygamous, but does not form harems. Heat usually occurs from mid-July to mid-September; during this period males are territorial. Young are born in May-June; females give birth to one or two calves (rarely up to four).";;There are no major threats to whole population. However, poaching might be a threat to the isolated population in the Cis-Caucasus.
M4;Alces_alces;Alces alces is found in a range of woodland habitats, both coniferous and broadleaved, from the tundra and taiga southwards through boreal to temperate zones. It tends to prefer damp, marshy habitats and areas in close proximity to water. It is also found in open country in the lowlands and mountains, including farmland, if there is forest nearby. It thrives in secondary growth, and its population expansion in Scandinavia has been linked to the replacement of natural taiga forest by secondary woodland after logging (Bauer and Nygrén 1999). It feeds on vegetative parts of trees, shrubs, dwarf shrubs, herbs, and aquatic plants, and is a pest of agriculture and forestry in at least parts of its range (Ruusila and Kojola in press). The species has seasonal movements in parts of its range, particularly in northern Europe.;;There are no major threats to this species at present. A wasting disease has been reported, and its causes remain poorly understood (Frank 2004), but it is not considered to be a serious problem for the species. Overexploitation caused significant population declines and range contractions in the 18th and 19th centuries, but since then populations have recovered (Ruusila and Kojola in press, Bauer and Nygrén 1999). In most European range states, populations are controlled to prevent damage to forestry and arable crops (Bauer and Nygrén 1999).
M38;Capreolus_capreolus;It occupies a wide variety of habitats, including deciduous, mixed or coniferous forests, moorland, pastures, arable land, and suburban areas with large gardens. It prefers landscapes with a mosaic of woodland and farmland (Stubbe 1999). Roe deer are well adapted to modern agricultural landscapes (Sempéré et al. 1996).;;The main threat in Europe is the increased mixing of various genetic stocks as a result of translocations. This may be a particular threat to genetically distinct peripheral populations, such as those in northern Portugal, the southern Italian Apennines, and Greece (Randi et al. 2004, Lorenzini and Lovari 2006). Molecular studies show that roe deer in central and southern Europe are mainly admixed (Lorenzini et al. 2002, Randi et al. 2004), indicating that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic structure of populations. The small remaining population of C. c. italicus is also threatened by poaching and predation by feral dogs (Lorenzini et al. 2002)
M59;Dama_dama;A highly adaptable species that can survive in a wide range of habitats.;;There are no major threats to this species in Europe. In the species' native range outside Europe, hunting and habitat conversion for agriculture caused massive declines in the past, and habitat degradation continues to be a serious threat (Wemmer 1998).
M221;Rangifer_tarandus;It inhabits arctic and subarctic tundra, open montane habitats, and open woodland, where it feeds on lichens, mosses, grasses, and shoots and leaves of deciduous shrubs and trees (especially willow Salix spp. and birch Betula spp.). In North America it is a migratory species, making seasonal movements from the coast in summer to the interior in winter, but in Europe reindeer are more sedentary (Herre 1986).;;Poaching is a major threat in the Russian Federation (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006). The causes of decline of the Novaya Zemlya subspecies pearsoni are not known (A. Tikhonov pers. comm. 2006). Loss of habitat in Finland (through logging) may pose problems, and there is increased disturbance to the species in some areas due to winter sporting activities. Hybridization with semidomesticated reindeer is a potential problem for some subspecies and subpopulations (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006, Ruusila and Kojola in press).
M41;Cervus_elaphus;It inhabits open deciduous woodland, upland moors and open mountainous areas (sometimes above the treeline), natural grasslands, pastures and meadows (Koubek and Zima 1999). In woodland, its diet consists mainly of shrub and tree shoots, but in other habitats it also consumes grasses, sedges and shrubs.;;The main threat is the intermixing of the various subspecies, including subspecies from North America (wapiti) and Asia, as well as hybridisation with sika deer Cervus nippon (Koubek and Zima 1999, EMA Workshop 2006). The introduction of animals from North America has also resulted in the spread of parasites and diseases to previously unaffected subpopulations (e.g. liver worms). Overhunting and habitat loss as a result of agricultural intensification and urbanisation are other pressures (Wemmer 1998), but they are not thought to pose a major threat to the species at present (EMA Workshop 2006).
M278;Sus_scrofa;It is found in a variety of temperate and tropical habitats. It prefers broadleaved forests and especially evergreen oak forests, but may also be found in more open habitats such as steppe, mediterranean shrubland, and farmland, so long as there is water and tree cover nearby (Spitz 1999). It has an omnivorous diet, consuming vegetable matter (e.g. beech mast, acorns, green plants, tubers), carrion, and live animal prey (earthworms, insect larvae, small vertebrates) (Herre 1986, Oliver 1993).;;There are no major threats to the species. It is considered a pest in parts of its range (Oliver 1993, Battersby 2005). Tuberculosis may be an issue in some areas, especially in managed populations. The disease does not kill the animals, but it is becoming increasingly prevalent (EMA Workshop 2006). Occasionally there are outbreaks of swine fever and African swine fever which cause local mortality, but populations recover rapidly (Oliver 1993). Habitat destruction, hunting (for food and sport), and persecution (often in reprisal for crop damage) may cause local declines in parts of the range (Oliver 1993).
M279;Tadarida_teniotis;It usually forages at 10-50 m above the ground over temperate to sub-desert habitats, although it also occurs humid habitats in some areas (e.g. Turkey: A. Altiparmak pers. comm. 2005) It feeds on aerial drifts of insects including moths and neuropterans. Summer and winter roosts: fissures and hollows in rock outcrops, quarries and cliffs. Common in some urban areas, roosts also in artificial structures, including bridges and buildings, and sometimes in the roof of high caves. The species is probably sedentary (Hutterer et al. 2005).;;It is negatively affected by disturbance and loss of roosts in buildings, and by use of pesticides. It is also potentially threatened by wind farms (European Mammal Assessment workshop 2006), and deforestation affects the species in some parts of its range (Z. Amr pers. comm. 2005). However, none of these are considered to be major threats at present.
M230;Rousettus_aegyptiacus;;;
M227;Rhinolophus_hipposideros;Forages close to ground within and along the edges of broadleaf deciduous woodland, riparian vegetation, Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean shrubland. Feeds mainly on midges, moths and craneflies. Summer roosts (breeding colonies): natural and artificial underground sites in the southern part of the range, attics and buildings in the northern part. Winter: hibernates in underground sites (including cellars, small caves and burrows). Sedentary, winter and summer roosts usually within 5-10km (longest distance recorded 153 km: Heymer 1964 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Threats include disturbance and loss of underground habitats and attics (conversion of attics in human habitat), change of management regime of agricultural areas (loss of tree lines and hedgerows), and fragmentation and isolation of habitats.
M228;Rhinolophus_mehelyi;Forages in Mediterranean and dry sub-tropical shrubland and woodland, and in dry steppes. It feeds mainly on moths, but also preys on other insects. Summer roosts are in warm caves, often in karstic regions. Winter hibernacula are in colder underground sites (usually large caves with a constant microclimate). The species only roosts in caves and does not use artifical habitats. Sedentary (longest distance recorded 90km: Palmeirim and Rodrigues 1992).;;The species is affected by disturbance and loss of underground habitats, changes in foraging habitats, and destruction of caves by tourism.
M226;Rhinolophus_ferrumequinum;It forages in pastures, deciduous temperate woodland, Mediterranean and sub-mediterranean shrubland and woodland. Feeds on beetles and moths at low level in pastures and in trees (by aerial hawking or perch feeding).Summer roosts are located in warm natural and artificial underground sites, and attics in the northern part of the range. Where the species occupies buildings, it requires particular features of the building itself, as well as proximity to good foraging areas and underground sites for torpor at various times of year and for winter hibernation (Hutson et al. 2001). In winter it hibernates in cold underground sites (usually large caves). A sedentary species, distances of 20-30 km between winter and summer roosts are typical (longest distance recorded 180km: de Paz et al. 1986).;;The main threats are fragmentation and isolation of habitats, change of management regime of deciduous forests and agricultural areas, loss of insects due to pesticide use, and disturbance and loss of underground habitats and attics. In northwest Europe, habitat change is likely to have been amongst the major causes of declines, the conversion of woodland and small-field landscape to large-scale agricultural land being particularly damaging. While declines elsewhere, particularly in eastern Europe, may currently not be so marked, the loss of cultural landscapes in those countries as they move towards western-style economies may have significant effects in the near future. The use of pesticides has been a recognized threat to the insect food, particularly where these have been directed against the larvae of favoured food items, such as melolonthid beetles, larvae of noctuid moths or crane-flies. Favoured prey may be affected secondarily by pesticide use, such as the loss of dung fauna from the use of persistent anti-parasitic drugs (avermectins) on cattle. Populations in caves and other underground habitats have suffered from increased disturbance (e.g. by tourist visits), changes of use and the destruction of such sites. In buildings colonies may be affected by human intolerance, renovation work or the application of pesticides, such as some of those used for the remedial treatment of timbers (Hutson et al. 2001).
M224;Rhinolophus_blasii;In the Mediterranean region it typically forages in shrubland and woodland, although it may penetrate to desert habitat (Amr 2000). Summer roosts are situated in natural and artificial underground sites, with attics also being used in the northern part of the range. In winter, it hibernates in underground sites. This species is considered to be sedentary (Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Threats to the species include loss of Mediterranean woodlands, disturbance and loss of underground habitats, and destruction of roost sites (Kryštufek 1999). In a number of range states the species is disturbed by tourist visits to caves.
M225;Rhinolophus_euryale;It forages in Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean shrubland and woodland, feeding on moths and other insects. In Italy, preferred foraging habitats are broadleaved woodland and riparian vegetation. Summer roosts are located in natural and artificial underground sites, as well as attics in some part of the range. In winter it hibernates in underground sites (usually large caves with a constant microclimate). It is a sedentary species (the longest recorded distance travelled by an individual is 134 km) (Heymer 1964 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;"; coniferous woodland is avoided, and shrubland is rarely used (Russo et al. 2002)";Threats include loss of foraging habitat, and disturbance and loss of underground habitats. On a landscape scale, fragmentation and loss of linear elements such as hedgerows and riparian vegetation is a problem because such elements are used for commuting. The species' strong dependence upon caves for roosting makes it particularly sensitive to cave disturbance, such as that from caving or tourism. Tourist disturbance of caves affects the species in a number of range states, including Italy, Iran and Turkey (M. Sharifi and A. Karatash pers. comm. 2005, D. Russo pers. comm. 2006). The use of organochlorine pesticides is believed to have contributed to the earlier dramatic decline of the species in France (Brosset et al. 1988).
M207;Pipistrellus_maderensis;It forages over a wide range of habitats, including aquatic habitats, woodland and farmland (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). It feeds on flying insects, including small moths and flies. Breeding colonies have been found in crevices in sea-cliffs and underneath the roofs of houses, as well as in bird boxes (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Roost sites include rock crevices, bird boxes, and crevices in (often disused) buildings. It is often associated with human settlements.;;Loss of natural habitat may be a threat, although the species is apparently adapted to man-made habitats. The use of agricultural pesticides may be a problem, and disturbance to roosts in buildings may also be of concern.
M206;Pipistrellus_kuhlii;It forages over variety of habitats, including agricultural and urban areas (including around street lights). It feeds on small insects, including Diptera, Psocoptera, and Coleoptera. Summer maternity colonies are located in crevices in buildings. Winter sites include rock crevices and cellars. Kuhl’s pipistrelle is probably a sedentary species (Hutterer et al. 2005).;;No major threats are known.
M198;Nyctalus_noctula;It forages over wetland, woodland and pasture, feeding on larger moths, beetles and flies. Summer colonies are in tree holes, sometimes in buildings. Winter hibernacula are in rock crevices, caves, occasionally artificial structures. Maternity colonies number 20-50 females (occasionally up to 100), but winter groups in rock crevices, caves and artificial structures can be large, to 10,000 in one instance (Germany) (Harrje 1994, Mayer et al. 2002). Tree holes and bat boxes are also used as wintering sites. Seasonal migrations between breeding area and hibernation range which is situated in central and southwest Europe normally cover distances of less than 1,000 km. The longest recorded movement is 1,546 km (Hutterer et al. 2005).;;The species is affected by loss of tree roost holes in northeastern Europe. In Romania and Hungary colonies are being lost due to renovation of buildings and human disturbance in buildings. Local declines in the Netherlands were linked to loss of wetlands (Bogdanowicz 1999). These are not thought to be major threats to the species as a whole at present.
M197;Nyctalus_leisleri;It forages over woodland, pasture, and river valleys, where it feeds on flies (including mosquitos), moths and beetles. It is linked to old trees. Summer nursery roosts are located in tree holes, plus buildings and bat boxes. Nursery colonies usually number 20-50 females, occasionally up to 1,000 (e.g., in Ireland: Stebbings and Griffith 1986). In winter it hibernates mainly in tree holes, or occasionally in underground sites or buildings, often in large groups. Females migrate over distances up to 1,567 km (Ohlendorf et al. 2000).;;Threats include disturbance to and destruction of roosts in trees and buildings, and loss or degradation of foraging habitat. However, these are not thought to be major threats at present.
M196;Nyctalus_lasiopterus;It forages over mixed and deciduous forest and wooded river valleys (the latter especially on migration). It is highly dependent on mature forest. It is largely insectivorous, but is also reported to take small passerines in the southern part of the range during migration. In summer it roosts in hollow trees, and occasionally in buildings. Rock crevices may also be used as hibernacula in winter. It sometimes roosts with other species such as N. noctula. Nursery colonies are usually relatively small (up to 35 females). Females give birth to a single pup per litter. It is considered to be migratory in the north-east of its range, but there is very little data. Vagrants have been recorded well outside the normal range (Hutterer et al. 2005). Some areas in the western part of the range appear to be occupied exclusively by males, according to capture results. Its foraging range may be greater than 30 km in a single night.;;Little is known about potential threats, but loss of mature woodland and loss of or disturbance to roost sites (in old trees and buildings) may have a negative impact on the species. Some individuals were found dead in wind farms in Spain (J.T. Alcalde pers. comm. 2006), and all pups were found dead in 2005 at one of the two known colonies in Spain (located in a city park). The cause of these deaths was not known (J.T. Alcalde pers. comm. 2006).
M195;Nyctalus_azoreum;It forages over a variety of habitats on the islands, favouring natural and semi-natural habitats. But it frequently feeds around artificial lighting (e.g. streetlamps). Most maternity colonies are probably located in buildings, trees and rock crevices.;;Human persecution, and the destruction of roost sites, are likely to be the main threats (A. Rainho pers. comm. 2006). Habitat loss and degradation, use of pesticides, and the spread of exotic plant species may also have a detrimental effect on the species. It is suspected that the extreme scarcity of the species on Santa Maria is attributable to habitat loss and degradation. This species is particularly vulnerable to persecution because it flies during the day, making colonies obvious and easy to find (A. Rainho pers. comm. 2006).
M189;Myotis_punicus;This species forages in woodland and shrubland and roosts in underground sites, possibly also in buildings. Bats ringed in Malta were retrapped in Gozo, but there were no indications of longer distance movements (Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Human disturbance is a major threat, as colonies are located in touristic areas, in caves that are well known and popular. Changes in land management and agricultural pollution are also threats.
M187;Myotis_nattereri;It forages in woodland (including Mediterranean pine and oak forest: Amr 2000), shrubland and parkland, sometimes over water, pasture, and road verges. It occurs in humid areas, and in dry areas it is dependant on water bodies. Summer roosts are in hollow trees, buildings and occasionally underground sites. It hibernates in underground habitats (caves, cellars and mines). It is a sedentary species, movements between summer, autumn and winter roosts are up to 120 km (Masing et al. 1999 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;;The species is affected by loss of woodland and other changes in land management and development. Loss of or damage to roost sites in trees, buildings and underground habitats may also be a problem.
M186;Myotis_mystacinus;It inhabits forest, woodland edge and shrubland. Summer maternity roosts are typically sited in trees, buildings, and bird and bat boxes. It hibernates in small groups in underground sites (caves, mines, and cellars). It is an occasional migrant, with movements of up to 240 km recorded (Gerell 1999). Movements of up to 625 km have been described, although the longest distance covered by a bat with certain species identification is 165 km (Gaisler et al. 2003 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Although not major threats, the species is affected by loss of woodland and other aspects of land management and development. It is also affected by loss of and damage to roost sites in trees, buildings and underground habitats.
M215;Plecotus_sardus;It occurs in the most wooded areas parts of Sardinia, and roosts in natural caves. Two of the three known localities are situated in karstic areas, one locality lies near the sea coast (Mucedda et al. 2002). Artificial habitats are not used. It is a sedentary species.;;Roost disturbance (as a result of tourism) and habitat loss (caused by forestry management) are the main threats to the species.
M214;Plecotus_macrobullaris;Is known from a wide array of habitats. In Croatia it was found in all altitudinal zones from sea level to mountain tops above the tree line. It occupies Mediterranean oak shrub as well as beech and pine forests (Pavlinić and Tvrtković 2004). The highest record is 2,800 m (Pyrenees: Garin et al. 2003). In the Eastern Alps maternity roosts are located in attics of churches, winter roosts are not known (Spitzenberger 2002), the highest record here is 1,720 m (Spitzenberger 2006).;;In the European part of its range, restoration of old buildings and development of tourism infrastructure is causing habitat loss.
M213;Plecotus_kolombatovici;It forages in a variety of open and semi-closed habitats, mainly steppe but also agricultural landscapes in both lowland and mountain areas. It often forages over small water bodies. It feeds predominantly on moths, but also takes beetles and flies. Summer roosts are primarily rocky cavities, but also dark areas of old monuments, ruins, caverns and buildings. Winter roosts are located in buildings, mines, caves, wells, and trees.;;Pesticides and roost disturbance have a negative impact on the species, but are not thought to be causing significant population declines at the global level. However, in Europe, where this species is largely restricted to coastal areas, disturbance of roost sites by tourists may be a major threat.
M212;Plecotus_austriacus;It forages in lowland valleys and open agricultural landscapes in central Europe, and in a great variety of open and semi-open habitats in southern Europe. It feeds mainly on moths. In summer it typically roosts in buildings (attics, fissures, cavities, old castles), although solitary animals may roost in underground sites. In winter it hibernates in buildings, mines, and caves. It is a sedentary species, and no individual has been recorded to move further than 62 km (Gaisler and Hanák 1969 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Some populations are affected by remedial timber treatment (poisoning by wood preserving chemicals) and loss of roost sites. Intensification of agriculture seems to have a negative impact on the species in central Europe, and may be responsible for population declines reported in this region. Agricultural intensification may also affect the species in other parts of the range.
M211;Plecotus_auritus;It forages in the vicinity of the roost in deciduous and coniferous woodlands, along hedgerows, and in isolated trees in parks and gardens. It feeds mainly on moths and flies gleaned from foliage. In summer it roosts in colonies in buildings (attics, barns, churches, drainage channels), tree holes, and bat boxes. Solitary animals also roost in underground sites. In winter it hibernates in caves, mines, buildings and occasionally trees. A sedentary species, its longest recorded movement is 88 km (Gaisler et al. 2003).;;Loss of broad-leaved forest and particularly of mature trees is a threat in parts of its Mediterranean range (Balkans, Portugal, Spain and Turkey). It is affected locally by remedial timber treatment and loss of roost sites.
M90;Hypsugo_savii;It forages over open woodland, pasture and wetlands, and often feeds at lights in rural areas, towns and cities.It roosts in rock crevices. Nothing is known about the migratory behaviour of this species (Hutterer et al. 2005).;, occasionally in fissures in buildings or under bark, rarely in underground habitats;There are probably few threats in its mainland distribution, except when roosting in buildings.
M210;Pipistrellus_pygmaeus;It forages around woodland and wetlands, and is more closely associated with water than P. pipistrellus. It feeds mainly on small Diptera (especially aquatic midges). Maternity colonies are generally located in buildings. No specific data are available on P. pygmaeus winter roost sites, but presumably they are similar to those used by P. pipistrellus.;;As maternity colonies tend to be found in buildings, the species may be vulnerable to anthropogenic factors, such as disturbance, timber treatment and building renovation (Battersby 2005). However, this is not thought to be a major threat.
M74;Eptesicus_serotinus;It forages over open woodland, woodland edge, and pasture, feeding on larger beetles, moths and Diptera.Most summer (maternity) colonies are in buildings (mainly houses) and occasionally tree holes or rock fissures.In winter it roosts singly or in small numbers in buildings and rock crevices, or often in underground habitats in north central Europe. Winter roosts are usually in fairly cold, dry sites. It is a largely sedentary species, with movements to 330 km recorded (Havekost 1960 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;;In some areas it is affected by habitat loss and disturbance and destruction of colonies in houses. Population decline in Austria might be related to food reduction due to large scale mosquito control with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, used in the Danube and Moravia regions (F. Spitzenberger and I. Coroiu pers. comm. 2006). The species is a host of the rabies-related virus EBLV1. There is increasing interest in the occurrence, risk to humans and epidemiology of this virus (e.g. Stantic-Pavlinic 2005), which could have an effect on the public image of this house-dependent bat.
M26;Barbastella_barbastellus;Forages in mature woodland, woodland edge (and agricultural edge). Feeds on small moths. Summer roosts: usually older mature woodland with maternity sites in trees (occasionally older buildings). Depends on a large number of old trees to roost in a large part of its range, because individuals change their roosts very frequently and colonies need a large number of roost sites for this reason. Winter: Hibernation may start in trees, but later underground sites are preferred. Usually in smaller numbers (up to 50) in natural caves, but in regions where these are missing in large groups in mines and bunkers. Underground habitats may be of any type, but usually very cold sites. Recorded in old mines in winter in the Caucasus (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005). Movements up to 290 km in Austria (Kepka 1960).;;"Loss of old mature woodland and ancient trees with loose bark or wood crevices (reforested areas are not suitable for this species: K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005); disturbance and loss of underground habitats, disturbance and loss of roost sites in older buildings. In Germany, habitat loss and fragmentation (caused by inter alia infrastructure development, forestry, and the renovation or demolition of old buildings used as roost sites), and disturbance (e.g. from cave tourism) are major threats (Schulenberg 2005); accidental mortality (roadkill) is also a problem (Rudolph et al. 2003)."
M181;Myotis_dasycneme;This species feeds principally over open calm water, particularly canals, rivers and lakes, on small emerging and emergent insects, often taken from the water surface. It prefers water lined by open rough vegetation without trees. Most of the known summer maternity roosts are in buildings, often in large attics and church steeples, in groups of 40-600. Some tree  and bat box roosts are recorded. It frequently hibernates in underground habitats ranging from natural caves to cellars and bunkers. It is a partial migrant, with winter and summer roosts often separated by more than 100 km (maximum recorded: 350 km), and it may need good habitat links between summer and winter roosts.;;"Threatened by habitat change, including renovation and maintenance of buildings with roosts involving the use of chemicals for remedial timber treatment that are toxic to mammals. Few nursery roost sites are known and many of these have been lost, although numbers in hibernation sites have shown a slower decline in the Netherlands. Water pollution may also be a threat; the species already has a relatively restricted foraging habitat of broad, open flat water of canals, rivers and lakes with relatively open banks, with possibly some further seasonal (summer) restriction within utilised habitat. Such restrictions in summer may be opportunistic rather than enforced, and it may be that the requirements for wider dispersal in spring, and possibly autumn, is more of a conservation problem than concentration in summer in good foraging habitat close to the roost. The requirements during migration are not known and may be a constraint (Limpens et al. 2000, Hutson et al. 2001)"
M72;Eptesicus_bottae;Forges over open habitats, including disturbed (e.g. agricultural) habitats and around street lights. Roosts in crevices in buildings (including ruins) and rock faces.;;"Not known; apparently a species that adapts to artificial habitats."
M292;Vespertilio_murinus;It forages in open areas over various habitat types (forest, urban, steppe, agricultural land). It feeds on moths and beetles. Summer roosts tend to be situated in houses or other buildings. Winter roost sites include rock fissures, often (as substitute) crevices in tall buildings (including, or especially, in cities), occasionally tree holes or cellars. Winter roosts are usually in colder sites that are exposed to temperature changes. Migrations of up to 1,780 km have been recorded (Markovets et al. 2004), although the species is sedentary in a large part of its range.;"; also rarely hollow trees, nest boxes, or rock crevices";Although not a major threat, the species is affected by loss of or disturbance to roosts in buildings.
M209;Pipistrellus_pipistrellus;It forages in a variety of habitats including open woodland and woodland edges, farmland, rural gardens and urban areas. It feeds on small moths and flies. Summer roosts are mainly found in buildings and trees, and individuals frequently change roost site through the maternity period. Most winter roost sites are located in crevices in buildings, although cracks in cliffs and caves and possibly holes in trees may also be used. It is not especially migratory in most of its range, but movements of up to 1,123 km have been recorded (Buresh 1941 in Hutterer et al. 2005). In at least parts of its range it seems to benefit from urbanisation (M. Sharifi pers. comm. 2005).;;As a high proportion of colonies are found in buildings, the species may be particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic factors, such as disturbance, timber treatment and building renovation (Battersby 2005). However this is not thought to be a major threat to the species at present.
M208;Pipistrellus_nathusii;It forages over a range of habitats including woodland edge, wetlands, and open parkland. Summer roosts are located in tree holes, buildings, and bat boxes, mainly in woodland areas. Winter roost sites include crevices in cliffs, buildings and around the entrance of caves, often in relatively cold, dry, and exposed sites. It is a migratory species, with movements of up to 1,905 km recorded (Petersons 2004). Migrations typically follow a NE-SW route (Bogdanowicz 1999).;;Although not major threats, the species is affected by habitat fragmentation on migration routes, loss of and disturbance to roosts in buildings, loss of mature trees with cavities and/or loose bark etc., and water quality changes which may affect food supply.
M156;Miniopterus_schreibersii;It forages in a variety of open and semi-open natural and artificial habitats, including suburban areas. It feeds mainly on moths, and occasionally on flies and spiders. It is a colonial species that roosts almost exclusively in caves and mines, often in large mixed colonies with other cave-dwelling bat species. Large and warm caves are preferred. Solitary animals and small groups may sometimes occupy other types of shelter. In winter it hibernates in underground sites (usually large caves with a constant microclimate). Schreiber's bat is a migrant species which changes its roosts frequently, long-distance movements occur occasionally (longest recorded distance 833 km: Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Disturbance and loss of underground habitats and pesticide use may threaten this species. In the Caucasus, disturbance caused by tourism in caves is a problem (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005). The cause of recent mass mortality events is unknown. A meeting was held at the 9th European Bat Conference to discuss these incidents. Veterinary investigations in Spain did not identify any disease as the cause of the die offs, and there is increasing belief that the die offs are caused by bad weather in late winter/early spring.
M216;Plecotus_teneriffae;It is highly associated with woodland habitats (coniferous and mixed), although it occasionally forages in more open and arid areas. Its diet consists primarily of moths. Recorded roost sites include volcanic tubes, caves, and crevices in abandoned buildings (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).  The La Palma maternity colony is located in a natural cave. This species is considered to be sedentary (Fajardo and Benzal 2002 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;Tree holes and bat or bird boxes are never used (Benzal and Fajardo 1999).;The population declined in the 1950s after aerial fumigation for pest control. Current threats include use of pesticides on agricultural land near to the forests, loss of woodland habitat, and restoration of buildings that results in the disturbance of colonies and the destruction of roost sites (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). The recent decline of the La Palma maternity colony has been attributed to disturbance, and it is known that at least one individual from this colony has been taken by private collectors (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Shafts into the mountains to collect water are increasingly being fenced which is detrimental to the survival of the bats.
M73;Eptesicus_nilssonii;It forages in open areas of diverse habitats, including woodland edge (or above woodland), small-scale farmland, parks and gardens with trees (van der Kooij in litt. 2006), over lakes and rivers and at street lights. In autumn, it forages and displays in high mountains above the tree line (Spitzenberger 2002). Its diet comprises small insects such as Diptera. Summer roosts are located mainly in houses, occasionally in tree holes. It may change roost sites during summer. Winter roosts are found mainly in houses, cellars, and natural and artificial underground habitats. In winter the species roosts singly or in small groups of 2-4 individuals. Long-distance movements of up to 450 km have been recorded by Tress (1994).;;The main threat is likely to be disturbance of colonies in houses (and possibly when hibernating in underground habitats). However this is not thought to be a major threat to the species.
M175;Myotis_alcathoe;According to present scarce knowledge, it is a tree dwelling and forest foraging species. In parts of the range at least it prefers to hunt in small valleys with deciduous trees and flowing water, which is a threatened habitat. The only breeding colony was found in a tree hollow. It may also occur in rural gardens and urban habitats. It probably occurs in underground habitats in winter.;;Damage to riparian forest is believed be a threat in parts of range (von Helversen et al. 2001). Wider forest and roost tree loss (especially in wet old growth forests) may also be threats.
M176;Myotis_aurascens;Recorded from forest and scrub (including Mediterranean-type scrub), and likely to occur in underground habitats.;;Potential threats include habitat loss (as a result of infrastructure development and other causes), and disturbance of roost sites in buldings or underground habitats. However, these are not thought to be major threats to the species at present.
M177;Myotis_bechsteinii;"This species has specialised habitat requirements, and is largely dependent on mature natural forests. In the south-west Asia region it is found in broadleaf forest and sometimes mixed forest (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005). In Europe, it tends to prefer mature deciduous woodland of beech and oak with a high proportion of old trees. Densities of this species are highest in forests that are managed according to environmental (rather than strictly economic) principles. It is occasionally found in artificial habitats such as pasture, plantations (especially orchards) and rural gardens. In summer it roosts in tree-holes, or occasionally in buildings; bird and bat boxes are fairly readily accepted (Schlapp 1999). In winter it hibernates in underground habitats, and possibly also in hollow trees. It forages in woodland and along woodland edge for Lepidoptera, Diptera, Planipennia, and also non-flying insects. A sedentary species (Hutterer et al. 2005).";;Threats include inappropriate management and development of woodland habitats, intensive agriculture (e.g. use of pesticides on farmland adjacent to woodland occupied by the species) and human disturbance of roost sites. The loss of old trees with hollows is a particular problem. In Germany, infrastructure developments (and associated habitat fragmentation) and forestry are the main threats (Schulenberg 2005).
M178;Myotis_blythii;"It forages in scrub and grassland habitats, including farmland and gardens. Maternity colonies are usually found in underground habitats such as caves and mines, and sometimes in attics of buildings (particularly in central Europe).It hibernates in winter in underground sites with a relatively constant temperature of 6-12ºC. The species is an occasional migrant, with movements of up to 488 km recorded (Hutterer et al. 2005; previous reports of 600 km are erroneous).";;Changes in land management, especially agricultural pollution and other agricultural activities, can affect populations of this species. Disturbance to roosts in caves and buildings may also be a problem.
M179;Myotis_brandtii;It inhabits mixed and broadleaf forest, and sometimes coniferous forest, often in close proximity to water (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005, Gerell 1999). It is less often found near human habitation than its congener M. mystacinus. Summer roosts are sited in buildings, tree holes, and bird and bat boxes. In winter it hibernates in caves and mines. It is an occasional migrant, with movements of up to 618 km recorded (Hutterer et al. 2005).;;There are no major threats known. Localized possible threats include changes in land-use practices (including woodland loss, infrastructure development and pesticide use). Human disturbance to roosts in builidings and underground habitats may also be a problem. In the eastern Black Sea area, it prefers to roost behind window shutters in older buildings, and these sites are not provided in modern buildings. Another popular roost site in this region is barrels hung in trees for honey bee farming, and when the barrels are removed to check for honey, roosting individuals are disturbed (A. Karatash pers. comm. 2005).
M180;Myotis_capaccinii;It forages over wetlands and waterways (including artifical waterbodies, such as canals and reservoirs), also scrub. It generally roosts in underground habitats (principally caves). Movements between summer and winter colonies are mostly within a distance of 50 km (maximum 140 km: Hutterer et al. 2005);;Threats include changes in water quality through pollution and dam building, and loss of water bodies and watercourses. Damage or disturbance to caves used as roosts may also be a problem.
M182;Myotis_daubentonii;It forages over natural and artificial water bodies (including fjords), sometimes in woodland or scrub. Summer roosts are in trees, buildings and other artificial structures (e.g. bridges, cellars). It winters in wide range of underground habitats. Seasonal movements between winter and summer roosts are mostly within a distance of 100-150 km (Hutterer et al. 2005). The longest distance covered is 257 km (Tress et al. 2004 in Hutterer et al. 2005).;;Changes in water quality may reduce food supply, and loss of or damage and disturbance to roost sites in trees, buildings, other artificial structures, and underground habitats may cause temporary localised losses. However, these are not thought to be serious threats to the survival of this abundant and expanding species.
M183;Myotis_emarginatus;It forages over scrub and grassland. Diet unique in Europe as it mainly feeds on spiders and flies. In summer, it roosts in underground habitats and, in central Europe, in buildings (in loft spaces). Sometimes roosts in summer with Rhinolophus species. It winters in underground sites. In Iran and the Caucasus, the species occurs in a variety of habitats, but in low numbers (M. Sharifi pers. comm. 2005). Mainly a sedentary species, but movements of up to 105 km have been recorded (Schunger et al. 2004 in Hutterer et al. 2005);;In Europe the species is mainly associated with agricultural landscapes, therefore all agricultural activities can affect populations of this species. Loss of and disturbance to roost sites in buildings and underground sites are also threats.
M185;Myotis_myotis;"It forages over woodland edge, scrub, and pasture. It preys on large insects, mainly flightless beetles, gleaned from the ground. It roosts in underground sites all year in much of range, and in buildings (loft-spaces) in summer in northern parts. Occasionally it forms small colonies in trees. It is an occasional migrant; the longest recorded movement is 436 km (Simon et al. 2004).";;In Europe, it is a typical species of agricultural mosaic landscapes, therefore agricultural activities (e.g. pesticide use, intensification that leads to loss of scrubby patches, hedgerows, and small woods) can affect populations of this species. Loss of or damage to roost sites in underground habitats and buildings may also be a threat. However these are not thought to be major threats to the species as a whole at present.
M75;Erinaceus_concolor;;;
M25;Atelerix_algirus;It is found in a range of habitats including semi-desert, dry Mediterranean scrub, grasslands, pastures, cultivated fields, and gardens, sometimes in close proximity to human habitation. It is most often found in arid areas (Lapini 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). It forages at night for arthropods, small vertebrates, carrion, and fungi.;;Threats include roadkill. Populations may be limited by the availability of suitable habitat (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). The species is sometimes taken from the wild to keep as a pet (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).
M77;Erinaceus_roumanicus;It inhabits farmland, parks and gardens in rural and urban areas, and scrubby habitats at the edge of forests. Like its congener E. europaeus, it is more abundant in artificial than in natural habitats (Lapini 1999).;;Many are killed by collision with cars (Lapini 1999), but this is unlikely to cause widespread population decline.
M76;Erinaceus_europaeus;E. europaeus thrives in a variety of man-made habitats including orchards, vineyards, farmland, parks and gardens, including those in urban areas. It also occurs in deciduous woodland, woodland edge and grasslands, although it is less common in these areas (Lapini 1999). Also occurs in maquis (R. Hutterer pers. comm. 2007).;;There are no major threats to this species across most of its range. In some areas, many hedgehogs are killed by collision with cars, but this is unlikely to cause serious population declines (Huijser 1999, Verkem et al. 2003). It is locally hunted and eaten in parts of its range, but this is a localised activity and is also not considered a serious threat to the species.
M87;Hemiechinus_auritus;Inhabits different types of dry steppes, semi-deserts and deserts. Prefers dry river valleys, gullies, forest shelter belts, abandoned irrigation ditches and shrubby areas. Often settles in oases and around human settlements. Lives in burrows that it usually digs itself, although sometimes it occupies abandoned burrows of turtles, gerbils, foxes and otters. Active at night. In nothern parts of distribution area hibernates from late October/early November to late March/early April. Heat occurs in April after hibernation. Gestation is about 40 days, females give birth to 3 to 8 pups (5-6 on average). In the European part of the distribution area it usually gives birth once a year, in southern parts often twice.;Avoids tugais and high herbage. ;No major threats are known for most of the distribution area. In marginal populations (e.g., Ukraine) it could suffer from habitat loss.
M54;Crocidura_russula;In the Mediterranean it occurs in a wide range of habitats including shrubland (maquis), open habitats, forest edges with abundant ground vegetation, cultivated fields, urban areas, gardens, farms, mountainous areas and land adjacent to rivers and streams (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). It particularly favours old terraces with dry stone walls. In northern Europe and at higher alititudes it is predominantly synanthropic, living in close proximity to humans in houses and gardens (Ramalhinho et al. 1999). In Morocco, it occurs in the mountains.;;Due to its synanthropic habits it may suffer from the use of pesticides and other toxic chemicals (Ramalhinho et al. 1999), but this is not thought to be a serious threat to the species at present.
M57;Crocidura_suaveolens;"At higher latitudes and altitudes in Europe it is often associated with human habitation, tending to be found in parks, gardens, and even houses. It is very common in straw ricks. In western and southern Europe and it inhabits a wide range of habitats including vineyards, olive groves, terraced farmland on hillsides, dry Mediterranean shrubland, sand dunes, rocky areas in the mountains, and damp densely-vegetated patches near to water. Small, soft-bodied insects form a major part of its diet (Vlasák and Niethammer 1990).In south-west Asia it has been collected from habitats with long dry grasses; thick vegetation along streams, river edges and vegetation channels; around houses and in forested areas (Bates and Harrison 1989, Tez 2000). Its main requirement is enough vegetation and moisture to support its insect prey, and in arid areas it tends to be more common near springs and oases; however it is more tolerant of dry conditions than many of its congeners (Qumsiyeh 1996). The gestation period is 28 days and life expectancy one year; a female may have 10-12 litters, each with one to seven young, although usually four (Qumsiyeh 1996)."; It tends to avoid dense forests (Vlasák and Niethammer 1990, Libois et al. 1999).;It may be out-competed in some areas by C. russula. Pesticides and herbicides may have a negative impact on the species in agricultural habitats (Libois et al. 1999), but at present this does not seem to be a major threat.
M58;Crocidura_zimmermanni;It has been collected in open mountainous areas that are dry in summer and snow-covered in winter (Vogel 1999). It is likely also to occur at lower altitudes, but if so its habitat preferences there are unknown.;;The introduction of C. suaveolens in Minoan times (ca. 2,500 to 1,500 BC) may have forced C. zimmermanni into a restricted range as it is out-competed for habitat (Pieper 1990, Nowak 1999). C. suaveolens is abundant in coastal areas, but has also been found in the mountains at the same sites as C. zimmermanni (Vogel 1999).
M63;Diplomesodon_pulchellum;Inhabits semi-fixed and fixed sands covered by saxaul (Haloxylon sp.). Active at dusk and night. Usually uses rodent burrows. Feeds mainly on insects and their larvae, often eats ants, sometimes hunts small lizards. Breeding season is from March to October. Young animals start reproduction in the second half of summer. Litter size is 4-5.;;There are no major threats to the species. In the areas of overlapping range Hemiechinus auritus and Crocidura spp. are food competitors.
M257;Sorex_tundrensis;"Prefers river meadows with osier, settles in fire-sites and overgrown glades. Along rivers penetrates to semi-deserts. Solitary, the size of individual space is up to 1,500 m2. Feeds mainly on beetles. Reproduction is usually in summer, gives 3-4 litters per year; litter size is about 7-10 young.";;There are no major threats to the species.
M255;Sorex_samniticus;A poorly known species. It occurs in shrubland habitat within forested areas (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006)). Hausser (1990) describes it as being found near streams, in bogs, and in hedgerows and stone walls in damp areas.;, but avoids densely forested areas (Mortelliti et al. 2007;Pesticides and habitat destruction (through agriculture and urbanisation) are considered to be the main threats (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006).
M56;Crocidura_sicula;Owl pellet analyses suggest that C. sicula inhabits suburban areas, gardens, pastures, arable land, and open scrub. In the summer, it prefers damp areas (Vogel 1999).;;No serious threats are known at present, although pesticides in agricultural areas are often a problem for insectivore species. Populations on smaller islands could be adversely affected by predation from domestic cats (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006).
M251;Sorex_isodon;It is a habitat specialist, preferring small brook sides with dense vegetation (e.g. ferns) within mature spruce and mixed boreal forests. It is also sometimes found in scrub and fallow fields, so long as there is damp, dense vegetation at ground level and a deep soil layer (Sulkava 1999). It feeds mainly on invertebrates, particularly earthworms and dipteran larvae, although plant material is very occasionally taken (Sulkava 1990).;;Preferred habitats are being altered by forestry and drainage (Sulkava 1999). Globally this is not considered to be a serious threat at present.
M253;Sorex_minutus;It tends to be found in relatively damp areas with dense vegetation at ground level, and it occurs in a wide variety of habitats including swamps, grasslands, heaths, sand dunes, woodland edge, rocky areas, shrubland, and montane forests. It feeds on invertebrates (Hutterer 1990, 1999).;;It suffers from destruction of habitat, use of pesticides and declining invertebrates. However, these are not considered to be major threats to the global or European regional persistence of the species at present. The apparent geographic isolation of some Iberian populations may make local extinctions more likely (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).
M250;Sorex_granarius;It is found in Atlantic climate areas, where it inhabits a variety of woodland and scrub habitats, including native beech, oak, and pine forests, plantations of introduced Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster, and damp areas with dense shrubby vegetation. It is also found in cultivated fields, stream- and river-banks, scree slopes, and rocky areas near to pastures. It prefers humid locations, and is restricted to areas where the annual rainfall exceeds 600 mm (García-Perea et al. 1997, Hausser 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral et al. 2005).;;It is not considered threatened in Spain, although its population status is not known (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In Portugal, it may be locally threatened by habitat destruction and pesticide use, as well as reductions in the abundance of its invertebrate prey (Cabral et al. 2005).
M192;Neomys_fodiens;This species is semi-aquatic with water repelling fur. It occurs in a wide variety of wetland habitats, both freshwater and coastal, including lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, bogs, damp grasslands, humid woodlands, sea shores and intertidal wetlands. It is the most aquatic of all European shrews. It hunts on land and in water for invertebrates, including crustaceans, and occasionally takes small fish and amphibia (Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Spitzenberger 1999, Smith and Xie in press). It paralyses large prey with its venomous saliva (Stone 1995, Smith and Xie in press). It is highly territorial, with males only moving out of territory during the breeding season.;;Loss of wetland habitats through drainage, development, conversion to agricultural land, and destruction of natural vegetation at the water's edge may have a negative impact on this species. It may suffer from a shortage of food when prey species decline owing to acidification and pollution of water with pesticides, fertilisers, and sewage (Spitzenberger 1999).
M244;Sorex_alpinus;In the mountains, it tends to be found in open habitats (meadows, rocky areas with sparse vegetation, and banks of mountain streams), where it lives in cracks and crevices under rocks and in stone walls. At lower altitudes, it prefers cool, damp, shaded areas, such as densely-vegetated ravines and holes under mossy rocks, tree-roots and logs in forests (Spitzenberger 1990, 1999). It mainly feeds on arthropods and molluscs (Spitzenberger 1990).;;Loss of alpine water courses due to water abstraction and hydroelectric power is also a threat, as is loss of habitat owing to intensification of winter tourism in the Alps. Human land use is a direct threat and climate change may be a future indirect threat as a result of range shifts in other species that may be direct competitors with S. alpinus when ranges overlap.
M245;Sorex_antinorii;Occurs in areas with dense vegetation cover.;;Pesticides and habitat loss (resulting from agricultural expansion and intensification) are the main threats.
M246;Sorex_araneus;It prefers cool, damp and shady habitats with dense vegetation, such as riparian forests and reed beds (Hausser et al. 1990). However, it tolerates a broad range of habitats, and it is present (albeit at lower densities) in drier areas such as woodland, scrub, road verges, hedges in farmland, and even sand dunes (Andĕra 1999).  It feeds largely on invertebrates, especially arthropods, earthworms, and snails, but it also feeds on vegetative matter (Hausser et al. 1990).;It is absent from very arid habitats.;Threats include general habitat degradation and an indirect threat from pesticides and pollutants (accumulation of toxins through their diet). In some countries, this is an indicator species for monitoring terrestrial pollution. However, the species is not considered seriously affected by these threats at a regional or global level.
M248;Sorex_caecutiens;It occurs mainly in coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests in the taiga zone, although it is also found in a range of tundra habitats including birch and willow scrub in river valleys (Pucek 1999, Finch and van der Kooij 2005). In northern Fennoscandia, it tends to be found in shrub-rich mires, alpine birch forests, and open mires, and at the south-western edge of its range in Norway it occurs in alpine habitats (Finch and van der Kooij 2005). In general moist habitats are preferred, such as damp parts of forests with thick moss cover (Pucek 1999).  The masked shrew feeds on a wide range of insects, spiders, and centipedes (Stone 1995). As it has a lower net food intake than larger shrews such as S. araneus, it can survive in less productive habitats (Finch and van der Kooij 2005).;Cultivated land is avoided (Sulkava 1990).;Extensive logging is a general threat to habitat and may affect local populations. However, at the global scale the population is not considered under serious threat from this.
M249;Sorex_coronatus;It inhabits a variety of habitats with dense vegetation at ground level, including woods, hedges, abandoned or unmown meadows, and marshes. It is scarce in intensively cultivated areas, and tends not to occur near to human habitation. It competes with Sorex araneus, and the microhabitats used are different for each species where their ranges overlap (Hausser 1990, 1999).;;Threats include general habitat degradation and the indirect effects of pesticides and pollutants (accumulation of toxins through the species' diet) (Stone 1995, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). However, the species is not considered seriously affected by these threats at the global level.
M277;Suncus_etruscus;It prefers abandoned olive groves, vinyards, and other cultivated areas overrun by mediterranean shrubs, but occurs also in gardens, low maquis, scrub, and open forest of Mediterranean oaks and pines, provided that old dry stone walls are available as shelters. It is more active during night than day, with a peak at dawn.  It experiences daily variations of weight, hypothermy, and torpor, as regulatory mechanisms of the high energetic consumption associated with activity. Possibly the smallest terrestrial mammal, its head and body measures 35-50 mm in length (Stone 1995) .;It avoids sand dunes, dense forests, and intensively cultivated land (Libois and Fons 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). ;It is sensitive to insecticides and pesticides, but these are not thought to pose a major threat to the survival of the species at present.
M52;Crocidura_leucodon;Its habitat preferences vary in different parts of its geographic range. In France, it is found in damp areas with dense vegetation, whereas in central Europe and Italy it prefers open agricultural landscapes. At the northern edge of its range it is associated with gardens and houses in suburban and urban areas, and in the Balkans and Asia Minor it can be found in moist habitats in the mountains including screes, stony areas, riverbanks and stone walls. In Asia Minor it is also found above the tree line in stony areas (Krapp 1999). In European Russia the species occurs in moist habitats within steppe and semi-desert areas. It feeds on invertebrates, including insects, insect larvae and worms.;;This species often occurs in open rural country, where it may be negatively affected by agricultural intensification (accidental poisoning and loss of prey species as a result of pesticide use, and loss of cover owing to replacement of hedgerows and fallow areas with large-scale monocultures) (Krapp 1999).
M191;Neomys_anomalus;It inhabits lush vegetation next to slow-flowing or still eutrophic waters (marshes, swamps, lakes, rivers, and streams). Its habitat choice is influenced by competition with the larger Eurasian water shrew N. fodiens, which is a stronger swimmer (Spitzenberger 1990, 1999). In general, N. anomalus is less aquatic than N. fodiens and can colonise areas away from water (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). However, in regions where N. fodiens is absent, N. anomalus may adopt its competitor's aquatic niche and increase in size (Spitzenberger 1990, 1999). N. anomalus is strictly carnivorous, feeding predominantly on soft-bodied invertebrates such as insect larvae, spiders and worms (Spitzenberger 1990, Palomo and Gisbert 2002).;;The major threat to the species is habitat loss. In many parts of its range wetlands are being destroyed and fragmented as a result of water extraction, canalisation of streams, agriculture, road building, and other human activities. Water quality is often degraded by agricultural chemicals, industrial effluent and sewage. Use of pesticides may be a problem in parts of the range (Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral et al. 2005).
M252;Sorex_minutissimus;This is a very small species (possibly the smallest terrestrial mammal species, although the pygmy white-toothed shrew Suncus etruscus may be slightly smaller) and it is very difficult to catch, other than by pitfall traps. It occurs from the forest tundra zone in the north, through boreal coniferous forests to mixed forests and forest steppe at the southern limit of its range. Within these zones it prefers moist spruce-dominated woodland with thick moss, but it is also commonly found in bogs and mires, and even in dry pine forests and clear-felled areas (Sulkava 1990, 1999). It feeds on small insects, grubs, spiders and snails, consuming as much as 2-5 times its body weight over a 24 hour period (Sulkava 1990, Macdonald and Barrett 1993).;;No major threats are known. Clear-cutting does not appear to have a negative impact on population densities (Sulkava 1999).
M49;Crocidura_canariensis;The Canary shrew's main habitat is the malpaís (barren lava fields), and it seems to be adapted to the hot and dry conditions of these plains (Hutterer et al. 1992, Stone 1995). It feeds on snails and insects in lava tubes, and it is cool inside its burrows even when temperatures reach 60ºC outside. The shrew is also sometimes found in gardens and abandoned arable land adjacent to lava fields, as well as in rocky gullies and sandy areas with rocks and vegetation (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). On Mount Clara, the species is restricted to a single coastal sand dune. More suitable habitat is found on other islands, however, there is a lot of urbanisation and industry.;;This species has a highly restricted distribution. Rapid urbanisation and infrastructure development in and around its range are causing loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat, and desiccation may also be a problem (Hutterer 2004). Introduced cats Felis catus sometimes depredate Canary shrews (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Other introduced species, e.g. rats and mice, are also present but are not known to have any effect on the Canary shrew. Of these threats, habitat loss is considered to be the most important (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).
M53;Crocidura_ichnusae;It occurs in a variety of habitats including pastures, cultivated fields, low shrubland, gardens, and old agricultural terraces with dry-stone walls.;;No serious threats are known at present, although accidental poisoning with pesticides may be a problem. The population on Pantelleria may be threatened because of its highly restricted range.
M284;Talpa_levantis;It inhabits various biotopes from the lowland to the mountains. In its European range it is found in meadows and deciduous forests. Only a few specimens have been collected in the European part of the range through trapping. The majority of records are based on anlyses of raptor and owl pellets. In the eastern parts of its range (the Caucasus) it also occurs in alpine meadows (B. Kryštufek and V. Vohralík pers. comm. 2006).;;No major threats.
M283;Talpa_europaea;It is present in most habitats where there is sufficiently deep soil to permit the construction of its extensive burrows. It prefers meadows, pastures, arable land, gardens and parks. It feeds mainly on earthworms, as well as other soil invertebrates (Niethammer 1990).;, and is rarely found in coniferous forests, or habitats with sandy, stony or permanently waterlogged soils (Kryštufek 1999);It is widely persecuted as a pest, but although this may cause local population declines it is not a serious threat to the species. In the past, it was hunted in great numbers for its fur, but this no longer occurs.
M287;Talpa_stankovici;It occurs in a variety of open habitats including sandy beaches, pastures and arable land (Kryštufek 1999).;;No major threats.
M286;Talpa_romana;Its ecology is similar to that of the European mole T. europaea. It is found in a variety of habitats including arable fields, pastures, and woods, and it feeds predominantly on earthworms (Niethammer 1990, Loy 1999).;;Local population declines are suspected in areas where there is intensive arable farming (Loy 1999). The mole is widely persecuted as a pest. However, these are not thought to be major threats at present.
M280;Talpa_caeca;It occurs in deciduous woodland, meadows and pastures in hilly or mountainous areas. It requires deep soil that is not too dry, which explains it sporadic distribution in karstic areas. Its diet is probably similar to that of the common mole T. europea, which feeds on soil-dwelling invertebrates, especially earthworms. It tends to be competitively displaced into marginal habitats by the larger T. europea in areas such as the Balkans (Kryštufek 1999). In Italy it is similarly displaced by Talpa romana where the two species occur in sympatry (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006).;;No major threats are known.
M285;Talpa_occidentalis;It is a burrowing species, and like its congener the European mole T. europaea it is found in a variety of habitats so long as there is deep soil that is not excessively stony, sandy, or waterlogged. It is often found in meadows and pastures. In southern parts of its range it is restricted to upland areas (Loy 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). It feeds on invertebrates, especially earthworms (Niethammer 1990).;;It is a pest species causing damage to pastures, so it is persecuted by farmers. Loss of meadows to afforestation is probably the main threat to the species, but this is not thought to be a severe threat at present (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).
M81;Galemys_pyrenaicus;The desman's preferred habitat is fast flowing mountain streams, although it is occasionally found in slow moving water bodies such as canals, lakes and marshes. It favours perennial rivers where the margins offer some shelter, and it requires clean and well oxygenated water. G. pyrenaicus is specialised to an aquatic environment. It feeds nocturnally on a diverse array of crustaceans and insect larvae, including stoneflies and caddis fly larvae (Queiroz 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral et al. 2005).;;This species is confined to a very vulnerable habitat in a restricted area. The most potent threats are from water pollution, and habitat fragmentation caused by the construction of hydro-electric plants, water extraction, and dam and reservoir construction (Queiroz 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral et al. 2005). Other threats are direct persecution from fishermen who incorrectly believe this species to be a threat to fish stocks, especially trout, or from over-eager collectors. Poison and explosives are used as fishing methods in Portugal, which would kill the desman (Cabral et al. 2005). The escape of North American mink (Neovison vison) from fur farms in northern Iberia might be negatively impacting populations in Galicia. It is predated by otters in Galicia (forming up to 5% of their diet) (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).Climate change is anticipated to be a serious threat to the desman in the near future. The species tends to occur only in areas with annual rainfall superior to 1,000 mm and, given climate change scenarios for Spain, by 2060 the species may be virtually extinct from central Spain and also in most of its important areas from northern Iberia (P. García pers. comm. 2007).
M60;Desmana_moschata;"A riparian species, it is found in holes primarily along oxbow lakes, less frequently by rivers and ponds. It does not inhabit all water bodies within its range; it has quite strict habitat requirements and prefers water bodies with rich water-marsh vegetation, bushes and primary forests along the banks. Prefers lakes with 1-2 m depth with rich invertebrate fauna. Also found in small rivers with slow flow. In favourable years it is able to reproduce during the whole year, but usually has two reproduction peaks at the end of spring and autumn. Males participate in care of young. Omnivorous, recorded feeding on at least 72 species of water invertebrates and 30 plant species, as well as fish and amphibians.";;The main threat to the Russian desman at present is the widespread use of fixed fishing nets. These nets, which are used by poachers, have become increasingly cheap and widely available in recent years: a recent study recorded 50 'outlets' freely selling these nets on the Moscow-Vladimir section of the Nizhny Novgorod highway alone (http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html). The very low price and high durability of modern nets means that poachers often leave them in the water for days or even months, checking them only occasionally and often abandoning them. A desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the desman depends upon. A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced nutria (Myocastor coypus) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) may also be a threat.
M99;Lepus_europaeus;A highly adaptable species, it occupies a wide variety of habitats, including grassland, steppes, open temperate woodland, arable farmland, and pastures (Flux and Angermann 1990, Homolka and Zima 1999). It tends to be particularly abundant in open, flat areas where cereal cultivation predominate. Woodland, scrub, hedges and shelterbelts are used as cover when the species is resting (Homolka and Zima 1999). It feeds mainly on grasses and herbaceous plants. When available, weeds and wild grasses are preferred, but where intensive agricultural practices have reduced the availability of these food sources crop species are selected (Reichlin et al. 2006). Unlike Lepus timidus, it does not feed on shrubs.;Dense old-growth forests are avoided (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006). ;Agricultural intensification, in particular the increased use of pesticides, fertilizers and heavy machinery in arable farming, is generally considered to be the main cause of population declines in western and central Europe (Homolka and Zima 1999). A recent study that reviewed available literature on the relationship between hare abundance, demography, habitat, and land-use practices in 12 European countries confirmed that the primary cause of hare decline was intensification of agriculture (Smith et al. 2005). It is inferred that this threat may impact on the species throughout its global range, wherever farming is practiced. Agricultural intensification in eastern and south-eastern Europe is a potential cause for concern, especially in countries that have recently acceded to the EU, or that may join in the near future. In Greece, restocking with hares from other regions has been identified as a threat to local gene pools (Mamuris et al. 2001). This issue has also been identified as a concern for the Cantabric population in Spain (Palacios et al. 2004). It is a popular game species throughout it range in Europe, but hunting is regulated and appears sustainable. Smith et al.'s (2005) review found no evidence of a link between hunting pressure and population density.
M201;Oryctolagus_cuniculus;The rabbit occupies a variety of habitats, including grassland, meadows, pastures, arable field-margins, sand-dunes, grassy cliffs, heathland and open woodland. In summer, it feeds on the vegetative parts of a variety of grasses and herbaceous plants, and in winter it eats grasses, bulbs and bark (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). It can be an agricultural pest in areas where it is abundant, and it has caused severe damage to native ecosystems in some areas where it has been introduced (for example Australia) (Ward 2005). Rabbits are an essential keystone element of the Mediterranean ecosystem in Spain and Portugal, being preyed on by at least 39 predator species including the Critically Endangered Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus and the vulnerable and range-restricted Iberian imperial eagle Aquila adalberti (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006). Rabbit declines are considered to have had a negative impact on both of these threatened species (Ward 2005, BirdLife International 2006).;;"Myxomatosis caused severe population declines in the 1950s, but numbers subsequently rallied as the myxoma virus become less virulent and the rabbit more immune (Macdonald and Barrett 1993, Macdonald and Tattersall 2001). Myxomatosis was deliberately introduced to Europe in 1952 in an effort to control rabbit numbers; it originates from South America (Ward 2005). Declines in recent years have been attributed to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD; also known as DHV), myxomatosis, and over-hunting (Ward 2005, Spitzenberger 2005). RHD is believed to have originated in Europe, where it was first detected in 1987 (Ward 2005). Habitat loss (due to agriculture, forestry, development, forest fires and land abandonment) is considered to be a contributory factor to rabbit decline in Iberia (Ward 2005). It is a popular game species, and over-hunting may be a problem in some parts of its range. Pest control measures may cause local population declines. There have been attempts in Australia to develop a genetically modified immunocontraceptive virus for rabbits, and accidental or deliberate illegal spread of such a virus could be a threat to rabbits in the future (Henzell and Cooke 2003, Trout 2003, Ward 2005)."
M96;Lepus_capensis;Globally, it occupies a variety of open habitats including desert, semi-desert, grassland and steppe. On Sardinia, it is found in almost all habitats on the island, but prefers cultivated land and maquis (Spagnesi and de Marinis 2002).;;In Italy the Sardinian hare is considered a game species, and hunting and poaching may have contributed to population declines. Predation by feral dogs is also a potential threat, and anthropogenic bush fires may cause local population declines (Spagnesi and de Marinis 2002). However, these are not thought to be serious threats to the survival of this species on Sardinia.
M97;Lepus_castroviejoi;"Little is known about the home range, population density, and food preferences, but they are likely to be similar to those of European hares in comparable habitat. No information is available on reproduction (Alves pers. comm.).L. castroviejoi occupies an elevational range of 1,300-1,900 m, descending in winter to 1,000 m to avoid snow.  This habitat consists of heathland where the dominant vegetation forms are Erica, Calluna, and Vaccinium and shrub where the cover consists of Cytisus, Genista, and Juniperus (Flux and Angermann 1990, Alves and Niethammer 2003).  A habitat suitability model determined that L. castroviejoi, ""selects areas characterized by a high percentage of broom and heather scrublands, high altitude and slope, and limited human accessibility (quantified as distance to roads variable) (Acevedo et al. 2007).  Its habitat also includes cleared areas of mixed deciduous forest of Fagus and Quercus (Palacios 1977).  L. castroviejoi also selects habitat that has been burned and areas where broom has been cleared within Somiedo Natural Park (Ballesteros et al. 1996).  Nocturnal censuses with spotlights in Somiedo Natural Park determined average densities of 6.83/100 ha (Gonzalez-Quiros et al. 1992).";;There has been excessive hunting at the western edge of its distribution where hares are isolated from the rest of the population during the summer (Palacios and Ramos 1979). In addition to over harvesting, this species is subject to predation, poisoning (fertilizer and pesticides) and habitat change (Ballesteros et al. 1996).
M101;Lepus_timidus;Mountain hares occupy tundra and open forest, particularly of early successional stages. In Scotland and Ireland heather moors and bogland are favoured habitats, and in southern Russia copses in the middle of open steppe and reed belts around lakes. The diet varies with the habitat. In Scotland and Ireland much heather, Calluna, is eaten, but this is not a major food item elsewhere in Europe where willow, aspen, birch, juniper, poplar, and Vaccinium are favoured (Flux and Angermann 1990). Palatable grasses and clovers are taken when available. Mountain hares are nocturnal, but there is increased daylight activity in summer when nights are short, or in winter when food is scarce (Flux and Angermann 1990). In areas where L. timidus and L. europaeus coexist, L. timidus retreats to areas of higher elevation, presumably as a result of competitive exclusion (Thulin 2003).;;It is hunted as game, but current hunting rates appear to be sustainable in most parts of its European range. L. timidus has successfully hybridized with L. europaeus in areas where the latter has been introduced (Thulin 2003). The pathogens European Brown Hare Syndrome (EHBS) and tularemia may be problematic, but research is required to determine how great an impact they have on wild populations (Thulin 2003). Competitive exclusion of the mountain hare by the European brown hare may restrict the distribution of the former (Thulin 2003), and anthropogenic climate change may affect competitive relationships between these two species. The discovery of an introduced population of L. europaeus to Ireland could pose a threat to the Irish subspecies L. t. hibernicus (N. Reid pers. comm. 2006).
M98;Lepus_corsicanus;Information about the ecology of this species is still limited. However, it seems well adapted to the Mediterranean environment, although it has been recorded from sea level to 2,400 m a.s.l. on Mount Etna (Sicily). The preferred habitats are the Mediterranean maquis and the mosaic of clearings (also cultivated), bushy areas, and broad-leaved woods. Furthermore L. corsicanus inhabits also coastal dune habitat. When L. corsicanus is in sympatry with L. europaeus, the latter species tends to be more a habitat generalist, while L. corsicanus seems to inhabit almost only pastures and grasslands. In Sicily, the species inhabits a variety of natural and artificial habitats: open grassland, bushy pastures, cultivated areas, etc.In terms of elevation, L. europaeus and L. corsicanus do not differ significantly when they live allopatrically. According to Angelici and Luiselli (in press), when the two species coexist in sympatry, L. corsicanus occurs at elevations significantly higher than L. europaeus. L. europaeus inhabits significantly higher elevations when it lives allopatrically than when it lives sympatrically, and L. corsicanus inhabits significantly higher elevations when it lives sympatrically than when it lives allopatrically. However, this ecological allocation is not shared by Trocchi and Riga who always directly observed, in sympatric condition, L. europaeus occupying the mountain grassland and L. corsicanus inhabiting the lower and warmer areas with thermophilous oak woods.The diet of L. corsicanus, studied in Sicily, varies seasonally as the available vegetation changes. Monocotyledones, Cyperaceae and Juncaceae, are ingested year round, while Gramineae and Labiatae are consumed during spring and summer, respectively (De Battisti et al. 2004).  Dicotyledones ingested year round by L. corsicanus are Leguminosae and Compositae (De Battisti et al. 2004).;;"The main threats to L. corsicanus have been identified in the following aspects: fragmentation of the range, low or absent genetic flow between populations, low population density, habitat loss, introduction of L. europaeus in central and southern Italy (with interspecific competition and disease spread - L. corsicanus is fully susceptible to EBHS), competition with the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus (mainly in Sicily, where this species is widely distributed), over-hunting, poaching and predation by foxes and feral dogs (both abundant and largely distributed in southern Italy). L. corsicanus is susceptible to accidental mortality due to difficulties distinguishing it from L. europaeus by hunters (Angelici and Luiselli 2001).  Potential hybridization between L. europaeus and L. corsicanus could constitute a future threat to the species (Pierpaoli et al. 2003).  On the major threat list ""other"" has been checked and identified as intraspecific genetic pollution."
M100;Lepus_granatensis;"Lepus granatensis can persist in a variety of habitats within Spain and Portugal (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999). It occupies arable lands of central Spain and mountainous forests of northwestern Spain (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999). Other has been checked on the Habitat Preferences list and has been identified as dunes along the Mediterranean coast (Mitchell-Jones et al. 1999).Reproduction in L. granatensis is continuous year round, with peaks experienced between February and June (Alves et al. 2002; Farfan et al. 2004).  It has been estimated that the mean number of litters per productive female per year and the mean litter size are 3.48 and 2.08, respectively (Farfan et al. 2004).";;No major threats to Lepus granatensis have been cited.
M40;Castor_fiber;Beavers are adapted for a semi-aquatic life, using a variety of freshwater systems, including rivers, streams, irrigation ditches, lakes, and swamps. They generally prefer freshwater habitats surrounded by woodland, but may occur in agricultural land or even suburban and urban areas (Tattersall 1999, Halley and Rosell 2002). In northern Scandinavia, beavers may be found right up to the limit of the willow zone in the mountains, where knee-high willow bushes are the only woody vegetation and it is iced over for 8 months of the year. This is not preferred habitat, but they can survive there. In many places, beavers live both on the valley floor, and on the mountain plateau above (where it is wooded), with a break in distribution where streams flow down the steep valley sides. In general beavers should be able to live in almost any freshwater habitat where there are trees or shrubs and the gradient is not precipitous. However, patterns of recolonisation demonstrate a clear preference for still or slow, laminar water flow if it is available (Nowak 1999, Halley and Rosell 2002, D.J. Halley pers. comm. 2006).;;"The beaver's historic decline was caused by over-hunting for fur, meat and castoreum (a secretion from the scent glands), combined with loss of wetland habitats. Beaver populations were severely reduced in most countries by mediæval times, but the species clung on in marshes and other inaccessible places until the advent of efficient steel traps and accurate firearms in the 17th century; and then through to the 19th century there was a rash of final extinctions for these reasons combined with drainage of many of the large marshland areas in which the species clung on (all of the European refugia where the species survived, except in Norway, are extensive marshlands). Today, beaver populations in Europe are expanding rapidly, and there are no major threats (e.g. threats of a magnitude likely to cause decline at the regional level). Competitive exclusion of the native European beaver C. fiber by its American cousin C. canadensis may be a threat in parts of Finland and north-west Russia, but it is not a major threat regionally. In Europe North American beavers are now confined entirely to Finland and north-west Russia, where populations are increasing only slowly (due to heavy harvesting). The former population at a reservoir near Paris has been removed, and populations introduced to Poland and Austria have apparently gone extinct in competition with C. fiber, the opposite of what has tended to happen in Finland and north-west Russia (it has been suggested that, due to differences in the life history of the two species, Eurasian beavers may have a competitive advantage at more southerly latitudes, whilst North American beavers may be more successful further north: D.J. Halley pers. comm. 2006). There are no serious prospects of further introductions (Halley and Rosell 2002, D.J. Halley pers. comm. 2006). The two species do not interbreed (Tattersall 1999). Roadkill is an important source of mortality for some populations (Tattersall 1999). Rapidly expanding beaver populations may come into conflict with humans in some areas, as they do some damage to forestry and crops. Such damages should be put into perspective: they tend to be less severe than those caused by other species such as deer and voles, but are noticed because beavers are a new and unfamiliar species in areas where they have been recently introduced (Halley and Rosell 2002)."
M46;Cricetus_cricetus;Its original habitat was fertile steppe and grassland, but it has successfully spread into a variety of anthropogenic habitats including meadows, croplands (especially cereals), and field edges, road verges and scrubby fallow areas on farms. In eastern parts of its range it is found quite often in gardens and orchards, in close proximity to human habitation. It is more abundant in these man-made habitats than it is in natural grassland. It prefers relatively deep, heavy soils, in which it digs extensive burrows. Its diet mainly consists of the green parts of plants and seeds, supplemented by invertebrates and, occasionally, small vertebrates. At high densities, it can be an agricultural pest (Nechay 2000).;;Its decline in western Europe has been attributed to a combination of persecution and agricultural intensification. It was trapped and poisoned to prevent damage to crops, and this practice continues in some parts of the hamster's range (although not in the western part of its range). In eastern Europe it continues to be trapped for the fur trade. Agricultural intensification, specifically the loss of perennial crops and small uncultivated patches of land, the introduction of autumn-sown cereals, and the increased use of pesticides, has had a negative impact on many hamster populations. Changing agricultural practices in eastern Europe, where the hamster population has traditionally been considered stable, may pose a threat in the future.
M61;Dicrostonyx_torquatus;"Inhabits arctic and subarctic tundra and forest-tundra with small Salix spp. bushes. Lives in colonies with simple burrows along feeding routes; nesting and seed storage chambers used collectively. Activity is multiphase and may occur around the clock. Feeds on shoots and leaves of willows and birches, and vegetation and berries of cloudberry, great bilberry and other species. Litters 2-3 times a year with 5-6 young each time. A migratory species.";;No major threats known at present, but climate change may threaten the species in the future.
M62;Dinaromys_bogdanovi;It is found exclusively in rocky karst limestone areas, typically being found in stone-piles in meadows above the tree line, less often in rocky areas below the tree line. It has highly specific habitat requirements (Kryštufek et al. 2007). It eats grasses and herbs. The species' life history is slow compared to other Arvicoline rodents: longevity is up to four years, age at sexual maturity is two years, and the species has 1-2 litters per year (Petrov 1992, B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).;;It tends to inhabit isolated, inaccessible areas that are subject to little human disturbance. However, interspecific competition with another native rock-dwelling vole, Chionomys nivalis, may possibly pose a threat (Kryštufek 1999, Kryštufek et al. 2007). There has been no research and monitoring to determine whether this is a major threat, or whether this is occurring over a long time period - there is only anecdotal evidence from the southernmost locality (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).
M70;Ellobius_talpinus;A typical subterranean steppe mammal. Lives in large groups, digs complex burrows which may be inhabited by around ten animals. Colonies are very mobile. Burrow entrances usually sealed with soil. Feeds on subterranean plant parts. Nesting chambers (especially winter ones) and foraging chambers are usually about 4 meters underground. Seldom emerges above ground (usually only to clear soil from the burrow or to disperse, rarely for feeding). During dispersal could cover distances up to 800 meters. No real hibernation, but in winter as well as during summer heat and drought, activity declines significantly. During the warm period of the year gives birth to two litters with 2-3 young in each.;;Cultivation of steppe habitat, fragmentation of social groups and populations.
M93;Lagurus_lagurus;"Inhabits steppes and semi-deserts, where it forms large colonies that dig branched burrows extending over hundreds of square meters. Feeds on narrow-leaved cereals and absinths. Also consumes bulbs, tubers and sometimes insects. Breeds up to six times a year, with 5-6 young in each litter (maximum 14). Marked population fluctuations are a characteristic feature of this species; during population peaks it is nomadic.";;"Destruction and alteration of habitats by humans (including climate change); pesticides."
M94;Lemmus_lemmus;It inhabits a variety of alpine and subarctic habitats including peat bogs, dwarf shrub heaths, and sparsely-vegetated slopes and ridges. Habitat use varies seasonally: in summer it prefers very moist habitats, whereas in winter it must use other habitats as wet areas freeze. During mass outbreaks, it can be found in forests, farmland, and even on frozen lakes. Large numbers of migrating lemmings may accumulate next to rivers and lakes that bar their passage, and many drown attempting the crossing (Hansson 1999).;;It has been speculated that heavy grazing by semi-domesticated reindeer may have a negative impact on the species' habitat in Sweden (Hansson 1999). Climate change may threaten the species in the future (Nowak 1999). At present, the species is not under major threat.
M95;Lemmus_sibiricus;"An abundant species in tundra habitats. Populations reach maximum densities in lowland tundra with substantial moss and sedge cover. Also distributed in wetlands on shrubby tundra foothills, and in wetlands at the edge of the forest zone (Arkhangelsk, Northern Urals, Gyda peninsula, Taimyr). Lives in burrows, forming large colonies. Digs its own burrow, or occupies existing burrows of other species. In winter makes tunnels under snow cover and builds large spherical nests. Feeds on sedges, cotton-grass, green mosses and various shrubs. Reproductive peak starts in June and ends in August, however, during periods of low population density reproduction is extended and starts immediately after snowmelt. Animals that have overwintered die off by the end of the following breeding season. During summer produces 4-5 litters with 5-6 young in each. Like Lemmus lemmus, this species has large population fluctuations with a 3-4 year cycle; however, migrations are less pronounced. In summer dispersal occurs and preferred foraging habitat changes.";;There are no major threats to this species known at present. Climate change may be a problem in the future.
M125;Mesocricetus_newtoni;It is found in relatively dry habitats including barren, rocky steppe and steppe grassland, Medicago, Taraxacum and cereal fields, vineyards, gardens, and scrubby slopes (Vohralík 1999). Its diet is probably similar to that of other hamster species.;;The main threat is habitat loss and degradation as a result of intensive agriculture. The agricultural utilisation of abandoned fields and steppe-like habitat is very likely to have a negative impact on the species (V. Vohralik pers. comm. 2006), although the species does inhabit some anthropogenic habitats. In Dobrudja intensive agriculture is ongoing (I. Coroiu pers. comm. 2006), and agricultural intensification may have increased since the accession of Romania to the European Union.
M128;Microtus_agrestis;It occurs in a wide range of habitats including grasslands, woods, upland heaths, dunes, marshes, peat-bogs and river-banks, tending to prefer damp areas. It occurs in a number of anthropogenic habitats including meadows, field-margins and young forestry plantations. The field vole is predominantly herbivorous, feeding on grasses and herbaceous plants, and gnawing bark in the winter. Exceptionally, animal prey (e.g. dipteran larvae) are taken (Krapp and Niethammer 1982).;, but is absent from heavily grazed areas (Zima 1999);There appear to be no major threats to this species over much of its range.
M130;Microtus_arvalis;It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as natural alpine grassland above the timber line (Spitzenberger 2002), grazed pastures, arable land, field margins and meadows. It feeds mainly on the green parts of grasses and herbaceous plants, and is a serious agricultural pest in some areas (Zima 1999).;Wet grassland and tall grasses are avoided. ;The decline on Orkney has been attributed to land-use changes (Macdonald and Tattersall 2001). Elsewhere it is not under threat.
M131;Microtus_bavaricus;The original site was in an area of Alpine meadows. However, the species was rediscovered in an open mixed forest dominated by spruce with abundant brooks (F. Spitzenberger pers. comm. 2006).;;Habitat at the type locality was lost following the construction of a hospital. The forests in which M. bavaricus lives in Northern Tyrol were used probably since medieval times as cattle pasture. This practice stopped in 2005, when in parts of the valleys the forest was replaced by fertilized and fenced cattle pastures. Through this M. bavaricus lost large parts of its known habitat. Habitat loss is expected to go on, as the open forests will become denser through lack of cattle browsing and intensification of forestry practices (F. Spitzenberger pers. comm. 2006).
M10;Allocricetulus_eversmanni;Inhabits dry steppe and semi-deserts, but is occasionally found in agricultural fields and the surroundings of settlements. According to Vinogradov and Gromov (1952) it is found near human settlements in Siberia further north than its original distribution. In the northern part of the range it is also found in forest-steppe (Gromov and Erbaeva 1995). In the Pleistocene it also occurred west of the Volga (Don basin, Crimea: Nechay 2000). Does not hibernate, however daily activity is lower in winter. Feeds on vegetative parts and seeds of different wild and cultivated plants. Also eats insects and molluscs on a regular basis, there are record of feeding on lizards, voles, small birds' nestlings and young ground squirrels (Gromov and Erbaeva 1995). Gives birth to 2-3 litters per year in northern parts of the range and 3-4 in southern. Litter size is 4-6 young.;;There are no major threats to the species. Eversmann's hamster is a pest of cereal crops, melons and gourds.
M132;Microtus_brachycercus;It is found in the majority of terrestrial habitat types, with the exception of high mountains, dense woodlands, and some very sandy, rocky or wet areas. It occurs in many anthropogenic habitats including pastures, arable land, gardens, and urban areas.;;No major threats are known.
M133;Microtus_cabrerae;It occurs in pastures, fields and open clearings in woodland, tending to prefer damper areas than the common vole. It is often found in proximity to water (Palomo 1999) and on road verges (Santos et al. 2006, Pita et al. 2006). Meadows and perennial grassland communities are the most favourable microhabitats for this species (Santos et al. 2005).;;Agricultural intensification, including overgrazing, has presumably contributed to range contractions and fragmentation over the last few decades (Palomo 1999). There is increased pressure on streams and other wetland areas the species occurs in. There is suspicion that interspecific competition with Arvicola sapidus may be a problem (Pita et al. 2006).
M136;Microtus_duodecimcostatus;It occurs in open habitats with relatively deep, loose soil, where it constructs underground burrows (Palomo 1999). It occurs in a number of anthropogenic habitats, including pastures, arable land, and orchards. It is also found in shrubland (le Louarn and Quéré 2003).;;Pest control can cause very significant local population declines (Palomo 1999). However, there is no evidence of global declines as a result of this.
M137;Microtus_felteni;It is primarily known from mountain forests, although it is very occasionally found on arable farmland at lower altitudes (Kryštufek 1999). This species is poorly known, but is likely to have a broad habitat tolerance (B. Kryštufek and V. Vohralík pers. comm. 2006).;;No major threats are known. The species is not likely to be affected significantly by habitat loss (B. Kryštufek and V. Vohralík pers. comm. 2006).
M138;Microtus_gerbei;At lower altitudes, it is found in pastures and arable land, whereas in the mountains it inhabits grassland and rocky woodland edges. Relatively cool (15º - 16º annual medium temperature) and dry areas are preferred (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). It is a fossorial species, although it burrows less in mountainous areas (Palomo 1999).;;No major threats are known.
M139;Microtus_gregalis;"Inhabits tundra, plains and mountain steppes and meadows. In the forest zone (including mountain forests) and semideserts it occupies open grassy areas. It reaches maximum density in cereal and grass steppes, and alpine and water meadows. Lives in groups, during periods of high population density may form colonies. Feeds on various wild and cultivated plants, tends to prefer legumes. Reproductive period lasts throughout the warmer months of the year; in tundra zones reproduction often starts under snow cover (in Karsk tundra in February-March). Has up to 5 litters per year in southern parts of the range, and up to 4 in mountains and northern areas. Litter size is usually up to 12 young. Considerable pest of crops in Siberia and Kazakhstan and pastures in Central Asia. A natural carrier of several diseases including encephalitis, plague and rabbit fever.";;There are no major threats to the species.
M140;Microtus_guentheri;It inhabits dry grasslands with sparse vegetation on well drained soil. These include both natural and man-made habitats (e.g. dry meadows and pastures) (Kryštufek 1999).;;No major threats.
M141;Microtus_levis;It occurs in a range of habitats including farmland, meadows, and open woodland. In southern parts of its range it tends to occur in damp habitats in close proximity to rivers and lakes (Zima 1999).;;No major threats are known.
M142;Microtus_liechtensteini;It inhabits pastures, meadows, open woodland and woodland clearings, preferring open areas with dense herbaceous vegetation to mature forest. In the high mountains it is also found in dwarf pine Pinus mugo, and in the coastal lowlands it occurs dry meadows, vineyards, and hedgerows (Kryštufek 1999).;;There are no major threats to this species. It is sometimes considered a pest, and is controlled through poisoning.
M143;Microtus_lusitanicus;It is found in a diverse range of habitat types, including natural habitats (borders of small rivers, chestnut and oak woodland) and agricultural areas (pastures, arable land, rice fields, and orchards). It requires soft and humid soils with dense vegetal cover, where it constructs its burrows. It is often found near to small stone walls (Palomo 1999, Palomo and Gisbert 2002). There are 2.2 young per litter (le Louarn and Quéré 2003).;;There are no major threats to the species. Pest control measures can cause local population declines (Palomo 1999).
M145;Microtus_middendorffi;Inhabits waterlogged tundra, sedge and Sphagnum marshes, waterlogged banks. Lives in colonies with shallow burrows in dry areas. Nest chambers are usually sited on hillocks, on the ground, or on shrub branches. The species feeds on sedges, leaves and stalks in summer and roots in winter. Reproduction occurs from May to August, in favourable years from March til October. Females that have overwintered give birth to up to 3 litters per year. In the Urals fecundity is lower than in Yakutia.;"; avoids anthropogenic landscapes";There are no major threats to this species.
M146;Microtus_multiplex;It inhabits pastures, meadows, open woodland and woodland clearings, preferring open areas with dense herbaceous vegetation to mature forest. In the high mountains it is also found in dwarf pine Pinus mugo, and in the coastal lowlands it occurs in dry meadows, vineyards, and hedgerows (Hausser 1995). The species eats roots and bulbs, and can feed on grasses (le Louarn and Quéré 2003). The number of young averages 2.7 in Switzerland (Salvioni 1986).;;There are no major threats to this species. It is sometimes considered a pest, and is controlled through poisoning (Kryštufek 1999).
M148;Microtus_oeconomus;It typically inhabits damp, densely-vegetated areas, in close proximity to water. Wet meadows, bogs, fens, riverbanks and flooded shores are all important habitats (Tast 1982, van Apeldoorn 1999).;;In the Netherlands, population declines have been attributed to a combination of habitat degradation and competitive exclusion (van Apeldoorn 1999). The population in Slovakia has shown population declines which are attributed to habitat destruction caused by the construction of the Danube River Dam (EMA Workshop 2006). Degradation of wetlands due to agricultural expansion is a further threat.
M149;Microtus_savii;It is found in the majority of terrestrial habitat types, with the exception of high mountains, dense woodlands, and some very sandy, rocky or wet areas. It occurs in many anthropogenic habitats including pastures, arable land, gardens, and urban areas (Contoli 1999).;;No major threats.
M151;Microtus_socialis;Lives in complex colonies formed by polygynic families. Burrowes are complex, but shallow, with a number of entrances and living and storage chambers. Above-ground activity is limited, especially in summer. This species mainly feeds on cereals and legumes. In autumn seeds predominate in the diet. May occasionally feed on insects and molluscs. Reproduction occurs year round, females produce up to five litters with 6-8 young in each.;;Widespread and abundant in the most of the range. However, several isolated populations (e.g. M.s. gorensis and M.s. astrachanensis) are declining because of desertification and landscape degradation due to overgrazing (Shilova 1995). These changes can be reversed through steppe vegetation restoration (Kasatkin et al. 1998).
M152;Microtus_subterraneus;It is found in a broad range of habitats including broadleaf and coniferous woodlands, meadows and pastures, and rocky areas in the high mountains. It tolerates both dry and damp conditions (Kryštufek 1999).;;No major threats.
M153;Microtus_tatricus;"The Tatra vole is found in two types of habitat: first, humid areas in climax upper montane forest (usually located in inverse valleys); and second, humid rocky meadows in the subalpine zone. The species is never found outside natural habitats. No population fluctuations or population outbreaks are known (Jurdíková et al. 2000, Martínková et al. 2004)."; (e.g. in agricultural land);There are not thought to be any major threats causing significant declines at present. The species requires old, mature forests below the timberline, hence any logging in those areas would be harmful. Its habitat in the subalpine zone, above the timberline should be safe in the near future. Much of its range in the Slovak and Polish mountains falls within protected areas, and there are not thought to be any major developments planned in this area in the near future. However, forest habitat is sometimes lost through natural events (e.g. in 2004 a big storm in the High Tatras destroyed a large 1-2 km wide belt of forest at about 1,000 m above sea level, within the range of the vole: N. Martínková pers. comm. 2006).
M154;Microtus_thomasi;It prefers open areas with deep soil, in which it digs extensive burrows. Recorded habitats include meadows and pastures on karst limestone, and high mountain pastures. It is also found on arable farmland (Kryštufek 1999).;;No major threats.
M169;Myodes_glareolus;It inhabits all kinds of woodland, preferring densely-vegetated clearings, woodland edge, and river and stream banks in forests. It is also found in scrub, parkland, and hedges (Viro and Niethammer 1982, Spitzenberger 1999).;;There are no major threats to this species at present.
M170;Myodes_rufocanus;It inhabits coniferous forests and birch forests, where it tends to prefer rocky areas, and is also found in dry peat-bogs and subarctic dwarf shrub heathland. It has a herbivorous diet, feeding on vegetative parts of grasses, herbs and dwarf shrubs, and on berries (Henttonen and Viitala 1982, Sulkava 1999). The species can sometimes be found in high densities in clear-cut areas, and is often found on plains (B. Sheftel pers. comm. 2006).;;There are not thought to be any major threats to this species at present. Declines in Fennoscandia may be linked to changes in forestry practices (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006).
M171;Myodes_rutilus;It is found in the subarctic birch forest zone and in northern parts of the boreal forest zone. It is more abundant in productive (eutrophic or mesotrophic) forests, with a dense understorey of grasses, herbs (especially Scrophulariaceae), or moss. It prefers mature old-growth forests and, unlike other Myodes species. It has a herbivorous diet, feeding on the green parts of grasses and herbaceous plants. In the autumn it stores seeds, especially of Scrophulariaceae (Sulkava 1999).;, it is absent from clear-felled areas (Sulkava 1999);Suspected declines in southern parts of its European range have been attributed to increased clear-felling of old-growth spruce forest (Sulkava 1999, H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006).
M174;Myopus_schisticolor;The species's main habitat is old spruce forest, where breeding tends to occur in areas with a abundant mosses (Pleurozium, Dicranum, and Hylocomium spp.), which provide a critical winter food source. In the summer, marshy areas within forests and pine-bogs with a high dwarf shrub layer are used, and in years of high population density dry forests and even clear-cuts may be occupied (Sulkava 1999). The species is found in the taiga and not above the treeline.;;There are no major threats. The species may be locally affected by logging of old-growth spruce forest, its main habitat (H. Henttonen pers. comm. 2006).
M22;Arvicola_amphibius;Aquatic forms inhabit a variety of freshwater habitats in the lowlands and the mountains, including rivers, streams, lakes and marshes. In Fennoscandia, the aquatic form becomes fossorial during winter months. Steep riverbanks with lush grass and vegetation are preferred. Fossorial forms are restricted to the uplands, where they construct extensive underground burrows in grasslands (including pastures) or, less frequently, in woodlands. Both forms have a herbivorous diet, feeding predominantly on vegetation in the summer and on roots, bulbs and tubers in the winter (Reichstein 1982, Saucy 1999).;;Declines in aquatic populations in parts of western Europe have been attributed to habitat loss, water pollution, predation by introduced American mink Neovison vison and competition by the introduced muskrat Ondatra zibethicus.
M23;Arvicola_sapidus;The water vole is almost always found near to water, preferring small (under 8 ha) freshwater lakes, ponds and slow-moving rivers and streams with dense riparian vegetation (Saucy 1999, Fedriani 2002). It sometimes occurs in drainage ditches and wet fields. Abundant hydrophilic vegetation and shorelines suitable for water vole burrowing activity seem to be essential characteristics of water vole habitat.  Its diet consists mainly of aquatic plants, grasses, and herbs, although small animal prey are occasionally taken (insects, fish, tadpoles, freshwater shrimp). The burrows of the water vole typically have two entrances – one primary entrance above water level and one underwater entrance. The water vole is mainly active during the day, with two peaks in activity in late morning and early afternoon, as well some nocturnal activity.  It is active throughout the year, with no period of hibernation.Reproduction occurs between March and October, with 3 to 4 litters of 2 to 8 young per litter, with the average reported as 3.5 to 6 young.  The gestation period is 3 weeks.  Sexual maturity is reached at 5 weeks old and the life span of the water vole varies from 2 to 4 years. The water vole lives in small family groups and, under optimal conditions, its density may reach 5 individuals for every 100 meters of riverbank (Saucy 1999, Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). There have never been any records of damage to human activity or agriculture by the water vole.;;Since the water vole is restricted to wetland areas, it faces all the usual threats associated with this habitat. The water vole only flourishes where the banks and vegetation have not been significantly altered by human activity. Consequently, habitat loss and degradation (as a result of drainage, dredging, canal-building, infrastructure development, intensive agriculture, and so on) are major threats. Competition with the introduced Coypu and Muskrat for food and dens is also a threat. In Spain, water vole decline is attributed primarily to anthropogenic habitat modification, but competition from the Norway rat may be an additional factor threatening the water vole (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Efforts to control invasive species by poisoning have resulted in accidental water vole deaths.In descending order of importance, the principal threats are:Secondary poisoning with anticoagulant rodenticides (Bromadiolone and Chlorophacinone) intended for the Norway Rat, Coypu and Muskrat, Competition for habitat and food sources with the Muskrat and Coypu,Predation by the American Mink, Polecat and Norway Rat, as well as domestic dogs and cats,Trapping and shooting of “vermin”,Habitat modification, including draining of suitable wetlands, dredging, canal-building, disturbance by human activity and livestock, etc.,Drastic variations in water level caused by dams or seasonal droughts,Pollution and possibly disease and parasites.
M43;Chionomys_nivalis;It inhabits open, rocky areas, typically above the tree-line (Amori 1999). It has a herbivorous diet, feeding on grasses, shrubs, and berries (Krapp 1982).;;In the northeastern part of the range the species occurs exclusively in rocky slopes. During the last two decades, these areas have been covered by enchroaching new forest as sheep grazing has declined (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006). However, this is not though to be a serious threat to the species at present.
M45;Cricetulus_migratorius;It originally occurred in dry grasslands, steppes and semideserts. Now, it also inhabits agricultural land and gardens, sometimes even living in houses. Arid areas with relatively sparse vegetation are preferred. It typically feeds on roots, shoots and seeds.;, and forests and damp habitats are avoided (Vohralík 1999);The species is rare, especially in the Balkans, and its requirements are not well known. It is not known why the species is not more widespread within Europe, given that it can use a variety of habitats.
M7;Allactaga_major;"One of the most ecologically plastic jerboa species. Inhabits various habitats; in the northern part of the range the main limiting factor is grass density, and the species is restricted to areas with sparse vegetation. In steppe zone often inhabits roadsides, field edges, pastures and flat slopes of ravines. In deserts and semideserts occurs in all habitats except moving sands. Prefers areas with loamy soils, with absinth and succulent vegetation. Feeds on underground and green parts of plants, also on seeds and occasionally on insect and molluscs. Has three types of burrows: permanent summer and winter, and temporary. Enters hibernation in autumn with the first frost. Exits hibernation in March-April. Reproductive period is prolonged. Pregnant females may be found from March to July. During the reproductive period females may have two litters. Litter size ranges from 1 to 8 young, usually 3-6.";;Declining very rapidly in the northern part of its range. Has disappeared from Moscow, Kursk regions. The main threat is land use change. The species needs large continuous habitats and fragmentation has strong impact on populations. In the Moscow region, habitat destruction due to building of dachas has caused the species to disappear.
M64;Dipus_sagitta;"Inhabits different types of sand. Also found in sand-dunes covered with pine forest. Most abundant in hilly and ridge sands, including those used as pastures. Often found together with Allactaga spp. One of the pioneer species that is occupying new habitats that have emerged as the Aral Sea dries out. In northern parts of the range it hibernates, while in southern parts it remains active throughout the year with the exception of extremely cold winters. Lives in burrows with length of about 5-6 m and depths up to 3 m; can also occupy burrows of Meriones major. In spring feeds on vegetative parts of grasses and shrubs, also eats roots and bulbs. When seeds start to ripen it switches its diet to seeds. During the whole year it takes insects and larvae as a usual part of its diet. The length of the reproductive period differs in northern and southern parts of the range: from 2 to 2.5 months in north to 8-9 months in south. The number of litters per year differs correspondingly, from 1 to 4 in differents parts of the range.";, however avoids large expanses of open sand-dunes;The species is common throughout most of the range and is a pioneer species that occupies opening sands in the Aral Sea area. However, pervasive changes to desert habitats are a major threat in the European part of the range. It is listed as threatened in the Don River region's local Red Data Book because of the fragmentation of its preferred habitat (sand dunes).
M220;Pygeretmus_pumilio;Pygeretmus pumilio is a stenobiont species. It inhabits clay semi-deserts with rare vegetation which includes succulents of the family Haenopodiaceae (Salsola, Suaeda, Nanopphyton, Anabasis etc.). The clay proportion in the soil and type of vegetation determine species distribution (Shenbrot et al. 1995).;;Populations are quite fragmented and its habitat is shrinking in parts of the range due to land use changes and climate change.
M237;Sicista_betulina;The range of this birch mouse covers a variety of habitats including boreal and montane forests, subalpine meadows and tundra (Pucek 1999). In Romania, the species occurs in birch forest and pine forest with dense ground vegetation (I. Coroiu pers. comm. 2006). In Germany it occurs in alpine regions and forest bogs (H. Meinig pers. comm. 2006). It has been suggested that the species spends summer months in wet meadow habitat and moves to forests in winter (Nowak 1999). It hibernates in underground burrows for at least six months each year, losing up to half its weight during this time (Nowak 1999).;;Agriculture may be a problem in the northern part of the species' range in Germany. In Romania, deforestation is the main threat. Elsewhere threats are not known.
M241;Sicista_severtzovi;The species is poorly studied, has a scattered distribution, and is solitary and naturally scarce across the whole range. Distributed in steppe and forest-steppe zones and associated with meadows with high grasses. Feeds on seeds and insects. Reproduces once a year, after hibernation.;;The most significant threat to the species is habitat destruction, as the soil in its preferred habitats tends to be very good for cultivation.
M243;Sicista_subtilis;It occurs in steppe, rough grassland and pasture, open woodlands, and in field margins and shelter belts on cultivated land (Pucek 1982, 1999). It tends to prefer more open habitats than the northern birch mouse Sicistica betulina.;;The species is susceptible loss of steppe habitat. In Romania, habitat loss due to agriculture and indirect mortality through pesticide use are the major threats (I. Coroiu pers. comm. 2006). In Austria, Sicista subtilis occupied a very small and relict range. It went extinct as a result of the conversion of natural meadows adjacent to the reedbeds of Lake Neusiedl into improved grassland (Spitzenberger 2002).
M5;Allactaga_elater;Inhabits various biotopes in deserts and semideserts, depending on soil and vegetation type. The species prefers sandy, rubbly and loamy soils, and is found on solonetzic desert. It prefers areas with a mixture of vegetation including shrubs. . Feeds on different herbs, seeds and insects. Solitary, active during dusk and at night. Lives in burrows with a length up to 2 m and depth up to 70 cm. Across most of its range hibernates for about four months (from mid-November to mid-March), but in Transcaucasia does not hibernate. Reproductive period starts after hibernation (in Transcaucasia in February). There are two reproductive peaks in April and in August-September. Produces 2-3 litters per year with 2-4 young per litter.;s, but never inhabits real deserts. Avoids open spaces and dense vegetation (Shenbrot et al. 1995);In the European part of the range it is not abundant and the population is declining due to rapid transformation of semideserts into steppes. Also land development reduces natural habitats and causes population decline.
M242;Sicista_strandi;"Inhabits floodplain meadows in the southern part of forest zone, steppes, and forest-steppes in mountain zone. Solitary, feeds on seeds, berries and insects; reproduces once a year after hibernation.";;Habitat destruction and fragmentation are occurring and reducing usable habitat.
M276;Stylodipus_telum;Inhabits deserts and desertified steppes. In Europe it is usually distributed in hilly sands in river valleys, and arid areas, often with trees. Active at dusk and night. Enters hibernation with first frost. Lives in complex burrows, often occupies jird burrows. Feeds on seeds and partly on insects. Reproduction is once a year with litter size of 3-6 young.;;Habitat loss due to ploughing and overgrazing, pesticides.
M85;Glis_glis;It is typically found in mature deciduous and mixed woodland, where it frequents the canopy, although it also occurs in maquis and shrubland on rocky areas along the Mediterranean coast. Man-made habitats such as gardens and orchards are sometimes used, and the species often enters buildings (Macdonald and Barrett 1993, Kryštufek 1999).;;In parts of its range, including Slovenia, Croatia, and Italy, there is a tradition of hunting this species. In the past, it was a source of meat, fat, and skins for subsistence and trade, but today it is hunted recreationally (Kryštufek 1999). The species is protected in Italy, but is sometimes illegally hunted (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006). In northeastern Europe, cutting of oak forests is a threat (Juškaitis 2003).
M68;Eliomys_quercinus;Its main habitat is woodland (coniferous, deciduous, and mixed), although it is sometimes found in orchards and gardens. It is less arboreal than some other dormice, and is often found on the ground in rocky areas, cracks in stone walls, and even in houses (Le Louarn and Spitz 1974, Vaterlaus 1998, Filippucci 1999, Spitzenberger 2002, Bertolino 2006).;;It has been suggested that it is threatened in some areas (especially Corsica) by direct competition with the brown rat Rattus norvegicus (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). The populations from Germany eastwards are declining (H. Meinig pers. comm. 2006), but the reasons are not well known, although thought to be related to habitat changes. In some areas of orchards, the species is considered a pest.
M66;Dryomys_nitedula;It occurs in a broad variety of habitats in Europe, including broad-leaved, mixed, and coniferous woodland (mainly at higher altitudes), dwarf pine Pinus mugo and rocky areas, evergreen Mediterranean shrubland, and wood-steppe (Kryštufek 1999). In the west, the species is found in moist areas next to streams (Austria, Switzerland, and Germany). The species is not found in human dominated habitats such as agricultural areas.;;There are no major threats in most parts of its range (EMA Workshop 2006). Declines at the western edge of its range have been attributed to deforestation (H. Meinig pers. comm. 2006)
M172;Myomimus_roachi;It inhabits scrub and semi-open habitats with trees or bushes such as orchards, vineyards, hedgerows in arable land, and river banks. Although it is found in some extensively managed agricultural habitats It is more terrestrial than other dormice, and its diet consists for the most part of seeds.;, it is absent from intensively farmed areas.;The range of this species is in decline. In European Turkey, most of its habitat has been transformed by agriculture. In spite of intensive searches the species has not been found over the last five years. It is clear that the range is shrinking.
M162;Muscardinus_avellanarius;It inhabits deciduous woodland, favouring forest edge, secondary growth, coppices, and other wooded areas with a dense shrubby understorey. It is also found in hedgerows in farmland. It is an arboreal feeder, foraging on flowers, insects and fruit.;;In north-western parts of the species' range, habitat fragmentation as a result of forestry, urbanisation and agriculture is a major threat. It was formerly a popular pet in some parts of its range, but this is now illegal in many countries (Morris 1999).
M91;Hystrix_cristata;It inhabits dry Mediterranean shrubland, maquis, abandoned farmland, and dry rocky areas. Its den is in a deep burrow or a cave. Its diet consists of roots and tubers (including cultivated crops), bark, and fallen fruit (Nowak 1999, S. Lovari in litt. 2006).;;Despite being strictly protected under international and domestic legislation in Europe, the porcupine is still illegally hunted for meat (often with dogs). This occurs both in Europe and Africa (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006). In parts of the range it is considered a pest species and it is sometimes illegally controlled with poison baits because of the damage it may do to crops (Macdonald and Barrett 1993), a practice which continues (G. Amori pers. comm. 2006). However, at present these are not thought to be major threats to the survival of the species in Europe.
M2;Acomys_minous;It is found in arid areas, including scrubby hillsides and rocky slopes. It may be found in close proximity to human habitation, and sometimes enters houses, especially during the winter. Its diet is predominantly herbivorous, supplemented by some animal items (Zima 1999).;;It is not believed to face any major threats at present (B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).
M13;Apodemus_alpicola;It typically occurs in montane woodland, where it favours areas with rocks and patches of grass (Storch 1999).;;No major threats are known.
M14;Apodemus_epimelas;It inhabits rocky areas with a sparse cover of grass or shrubs (Storch 1999).;;No major threats.
M15;Apodemus_flavicollis;It inhabits a variety of woodland habitats. It tends to be a forest edge species, but in the Alps it lives within forests (F. Spitzenberger in litt. 2006). Its spatial distribution in large forest areas is related to the productivity and spatial distribution of forest trees with heavy seeds, mainly oak and hazel (Juškaitis 2002).;;Globally there are no major threats. In the UK, the species occupied a wider distribution in historic times and has undergone a range contraction associated with the conversion of ancient woodland to agricultural land (Battersby 2005).
M17;Apodemus_mystacinus;It inhabits forest with rocky areas with a sparse cover of grass or shrubs. Rocky areas are important for this species (Storch 1999).;;No major threats.
M20;Apodemus_uralensis;"In Europe, it is found in a variety of habitats including arable fields, dry grassland, and humid woodland. In Lithuania, it is an ""ecotonic"" species, occurring where forests adjoin open habitat (meadows overgrown with shrubs, cornfields and fallow fields). In Anatolia and the Caucasus it tends to occur along streams and brooks in woods with a dense shrub layer (Storch 1999).";, and rarely found inside forests (Juškaitis 2003);No major threats.
M120;Meriones_tamariscinus;"Inhabits shrubby thickets in flood-plains and forest belts (in Astrakhan semidesert); also oases and shrubby semi-deserts with some grass cover. In NW parts of the range it is expanding its range and occupying new lands that have appeared as the Caspian Sea has dried out; however, in the Aral Sea region the species's range has stayed the same despite the availability of new lands. Lives in family groups, occasionally forming small colonies without social structure. Besides seeds, a considerable proportion of its diet is made up of vegetative parts of plants. Reproduction starts in February to March (western parts of the range) or March to April (eastern parts of the range) and lasts for about six months. Breeding intensity decreases during hot months. Females that have overwintered usually give birth to three litters per year; young females generally start reproduction in June. Litter size is about 4-5 young.";;No major threats to this species are known.
M121;Meriones_tristrami;Prefers deserts and dry steppes.;;No major threats are known.
M127;Micromys_minutus;It is found in wetlands, reedbeds, and clearings and edges of humid forest. It has also adapted to a variety of anthropogenic habitats, including gardens and arable land (in the wetter north-western parts of its range), drainage ditches, and rice paddies (Spitzenberger 1999). It has a high tolerance of disturbed habitats (Haberl and Kryštufek 2003).;;In Europe the species is common in wetlands (e.g. rice fields) and other habitats (e.g. abandoned agricultural land). There are no serious threats to the survival of the species here, although local population declines have occurred in some areas as a result of loss and degradation of wetland habitats (Spitzenberger 1999).
M157;Mus_cypriacus;The species has mainly been found in abandoned cultivation terraces at moderate altitudes (300-900 m), where the vegetation consists of a mosaic of open grassy areas, shrubs and small trees, and cultivated vines (Vitis vinifera).It can also be found in forested riverine areas at 100-150 m, where it is syntopic with the house mouse (M. m. domesticus). ;It is apparently absent from lowland (less than 100 m) areas with strong anthropogenic pressure, such as intensive arable farmland, human dwellings and farms, and orchards (orange groves), where the house mouse is almost exclusively dominant (Cucchi 2005).;It is not yet known if there are any major threats to this recently-discovered species. It is generally found in abandoned vineyards and terraced fields at moderate altitudes. This type of habitat has increased in Cyprus in the recent past, and is probably now more or less stable, although declines may potentially occur in the future as a result of changes in agricultural policy since Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, and as a result of housing and tourism development (Panayides 2004, M. Hellicar pers. comm. 2006). The use of rodenticides as pest control may cause mortality in populations that live close to human habitation.
M158;Mus_macedonicus;It occurs in a wide range of habitats including cultivated farmland, orchards, olive groves, road verges, sand dunes, arid Mediterranean shrubland, wadis, and densely-vegetated riverbanks. ;It is absent from dense forests, and avoids areas of human habitation (Macholán 1999).;No major threats.
M159;Mus_musculus;House mice are typically commensal, and are found in a very wide range of man-made habitats including houses, farm outbuildings, other types of buildings, and even coal mines and frozen meat stores. Sometimes it is feral in areas where it has been introduced, and in some parts of its native range it maintains wild populations in outdoor habitats such as arable land, pastures, coastal sand dunes, salt marshes, and scrubby road verges (Macholán 1999, Wilson and Reeder 2005). House mice tend not to be found in forests and deserts (Macholán 1999).;;This species faces no major threats.
M161;Mus_spretus;It is found in grasslands, dry shrubland, cereal fields and open woodland. . Their limited water requirements (half that of the house mouse) allows them to inhabit drier areas than other mice (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).;It is absent from dense forest, and tends to avoid human settlements (Macholán 1999);No major threats.
M21;Apodemus_witherbyi;"""Plains, mountain and plateau steppes, and highland semideserts"" (Wilson and Reeder 2005).";;
M160;Mus_spicilegus;"It occurs in a variety of open habitats including natural steppe grasslands, pastures and cereal fields, orchards, open woodland, woodland edges and clearings.  It feeds on grain and seeds, which it hoards in the winter in a soil-covered mound built above its nest chamber; a single mound may be up to 400 cm in diameter (although 100-200 cm is more typical) and contain up to 10 kg of grain (Macdonald and Barrett 1993, Sokolov et al. 1998). Groups of 4-14 mice cooperate to build these mounds (Sokolov et al. 1998).";It avoids forests and human settlements.;It is feared that loss of steppe grassland and agricultural intensification may cause population declines (Macholán 1999). However, in Romania at least, this species is considered an agricultural pest (Popescu and Murariu 2001).
M118;Meriones_meridianus;"Distributed in sand deserts, including fragmented alluvial and deluvial sands. Most abundant in hilly deserts and sandy areas with shrub cover, including small sand tracts in the steppe zone in the western part of the range. In spring and summer it is nocturnal, but in autumn (while foraging for winter) it remains active all day. Burrows are usually excavated under the roots of shrubs. Congregates in large colonies with pronounced social structure. Feeds mostly on seeds, sometimes on insects. Breeding period differs in northern and southern parts of the range. In northern parts it lasts from April til September, with two peaks in spring and autumn. In southern parts the reproductive period occurs from February or March til beginning of October, and in favourable conditions it may last throughout the year. Females that are at least a year old usually give birth to three litters per year; young females give birth once, rarely twice a year. Litter size is about 6 young.";;There are no major threat to this species.
M12;Apodemus_agrarius;It is found in a range of habitats including woodland edge, grasslands, marshes, reedbeds, cornfields, pastures, gardens in rural and suburban areas, and green spaces in urban areas (Gliwicz and Kryštufek 1999). Moist habitats are preferred.;;No major threats are known.
M19;Apodemus_sylvaticus;It is a very adaptable species, inhabiting a wide variety of semi-natural habitats including all types of woodland, moorland, steppe, arid Mediterranean shrubland, and sand dunes. It is also found in many man-made habitats including suburban and urban parks, gardens and wasteland, pastures and arable fields, and forestry plantations. It has an omnivorous diet including seeds and invertebrates. Although it can cause occasional damage, it is not generally considered an agricultural pest (Montgomery 1999).;;There are no major threats to this species, although pollution by lead and agrochemicals may have localized negative impacts.
M288;Tamias_sibiricus;"Typically inhabits coniferous and mixed forests with a rich undergrowth of berry-bearing shrubs. In mountains occurs up to the tree line. Climbs trees, but lives in simple shallow burrows. Summer nests are in stumps, fallen trees, sometimes in low hollows. Usually burrows consist of two big chambers, nest and larder, and small chambers used as a lavatory. Complex voice communication is characteristic to the species. Hibernates in winter. Short and long distance migrations have been registered during years with a poor harvest of Siberan pine nuts. Feeds on various seeds, mainly on Siberian pine, but diet also includes seeds of other coniferous and deciduous trees and herbs. In spring and summer consumes herb shoots; sometimes can eat insects and molluscs. From August onward stores up food for winter, storage mass usually 3-4 kg. Reproduces after leaving hibernation, in April-May.";;There are no major threats to the species.
M273;Spermophilus_suslicus;Like its congener the European souslik Spermophilus citellus, the spotted souslik prefers open areas with short grass (including steppes, pastures, and road verges). Unlike the European souslik, it can also sometimes be found on cultivated ground and can survive ploughing (Macdonald and Barrett 1993). It feeds chiefly on grasses and cereals, although arthropods and small vertebrates are also taken.;;It is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of appropriate habitats. Causes of habitat loss include expansion of agriculture and forestry, urbanisation, reclamation of wasteland and industrial development (Glowacinski et al. 2001, Piskorski 2005, Z. Glowacinski pers. comm. 2006). More than 50% of the remaining Polish population is threatened by the expansion of Lublin airport (A. Gondek pers. comm. 2006). In some areas, it is persecuted as an agricultural pest. Hybridisation with S. pygmaeus and S. citellus has been recorded, but is not likely to be a major threat. Currently all populations are declining and becoming more fragmented, which makes hybridisation less of a problem.
M272;Spermophilus_pygmaeus;"Inhabits absinth deserts and semi-deserts in virgin and long-fallow lands. Lives in colonies consisting mostly of non overlapping territories of adult females. Male territories covers several female territories. Each colony includes permanent (reproduction and hibernation) burrows and temporary shelter burrows. The little ground squirrel leaves hibernation in March-April; enters estivation in second part of June-July, sometimes, especially in dry years, goes straight from estivation to hibernation.";Avoids sites with dense high grasses. ;The main factors causing decline are natural climate dessication in the southern Volga Region, with a concurrent trend towards wetter weather at mid-latitudes. Neither of these changes in climate are favourable for the little ground squirrel. Additionally, human activities including pesticide use, irrigation, overgrazing and persecution have a negative impact on populations. Abandonment of agricultural practices (cattle grazing and arable farming) may be leading to unfavourable habitat change in some areas.
M270;Spermophilus_major;"Inhabits mixed grassy plains, and grain and feather-grass steppes. In the northern part of the range penetrates into forest-steppe and the southern part of forest zones. In the south it occurs in river meadows in semi-desert zones. The species is spreading as roads and development increase the number of channels containing water and long grasses. The species is able to cross the Volga due to the construction of dams in four different places. The dams contain ponds which keep ice over winter for longer, allowing the species to move. Another possible reason for observed range expansion is the release of individuals (along with marmots) by hunters. Lives in single burrows scattered over wide territories. In southern parts of the range where appropriate habitats are limited forms colonies. Adult males enter hibernation in mid-June; mass hibernation starts in August. Feeds on green parts and seeds of grasses and cereals.";;The most significant threats are ploughing and direct killing by humans.
M269;Spermophilus_fulvus;"Inhabits sand, clay and loess deserts and semi-deserts. In the forest zone it lives on black absinth and saltwort alkali soils. Usually digs a single burrows on a large territory. Sometimes burrows of the great gerbil Rhombomys opimus are used. Migrates seasonally from sites flooded with water from melted snow, or in search for fresh vegetation. Hibernation is extended; the species exits hibernation in mid-May and after 3-4 months enters hibernation again. Feeds on overground parts of cereals, absinths and saltworts.";;Although it is hunted commercially, this is not considered to be a major threat to the species at present.
M268;Spermophilus_citellus;The European souslik has quite specific habitat requirements. It is restricted to short-grass steppe and similar artificial habitats (pastures, lawns, sports fields, golf courses) on light, well-drained soils, where it can excavate its burrows (Kryštufek 1999, Spitzenberger 2002).  . It has an omnivorous diet including seeds, roots, shoots, flowers, and arthropods (Nowak 1999, Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006).;It avoids cultivated land, with the exception of vineyards in some parts of its range (Spitzenberger 2002);The main threats to this species are the conversion of steppe-grassland and pasture to cultivated fields or forestry, and the abandonment of pasture and its subsequent reversion to tall-grass meadows or scrubby habitats which are not suitable for the souslik (Kryštufek 1999). In Austria it is therefore largely restricted to vineyards, airstrips, golflinks, sport- and camping grounds and other frequently mown lawns where it is completely dependent on the toleration of the owners (Spitzenberger 2002). Although not a major threat, some Gypsy communities in central and eastern Europe still catch sousliks for use as a traditional meal (J. Mateju pers. comm. 2006).
M235;Sciurus_vulgaris;It is most abundant in large tracts of coniferous forest and also occurs in deciduous woods, mixed forest, parks, gardens, and small stands of conifers. Its diet is mainly vegetarian, consisting of seeds, acorns, fungus, bark, and sapwood, although it occasionally takes animal prey (young birds and eggs).;;The main threats to this species are habitat loss and fragmentation and, in Britain and Italy, out-competition by the introduced grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis (Gurnell and Pepper 1993, Wauters et al. 1997, Bertolino and Genovesi 2003). Now that the grey squirrel has become established on the continent, it can be expected that it may ultimately spread throughout much of the red squirrel's range. Grey squirrels not only out-compete the smaller red squirrels, but also carry parapox virus, which is highly pathogenic to red squirrels. Grey squirrels can carry the virus without being affected, and recent (2006) UK studies have shown that 61% of apparently healthy grey squirrels have been exposed to the virus and may be carriers (C. McInnes in litt. 2006). When the virus is present, the grey squirrel can replace the red squirrel 20 times faster than normal replacement rate (Rushton et al. 2006). The virus has not yet been recorded in Italy.
M234;Sciurus_anomalus;;;
M218;Pteromys_volans;It prefers mature spruce-dominated forests with a significant proportion of deciduous trees, especially aspen Populus tremula, birch Betula sp. and alder Alnus sp. (Reunanen et al. 2000, 2002). Large deciduous trees are an important source of both food and nest-sites: the flying squirrel feeds primarily on alder and birch catkins in the winter and alder leaves in the summer, and nests in old woodpecker holes or natural cavities in decaying wood.;;Modern intensive forestry and logging are the major threats to this species (Hanski et al. 2001). Fragmentation of forests is a particular problem for this species, as flying squirrels are reluctant to cross open areas on the ground. Managed forests also tend to have fewer deciduous trees (which are an essential winter food source), less decaying wood and fewer tree-holes (which are needed for nest-sites). In parts of Russia, it has been estimated that up to 50% of logging is illegal (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002). Illegal logging is particularly destructive, as unsustainable practices such as high-grading or 'skimming' are used, meaning that for every ten trees felled only one or two high-quality logs will be used (Kotlobay and Ptichnikov 2002).
M109;Marmota_marmota;It inhabits alpine meadows and high-altitude pastures, typically on south-facing slopes from 1,200-3,000 m (although it is occasionally found at lower altitudes). Colonies inhabit deep burrow systems in alluvial soil or rocky areas (Preleuthner 1999). It has a herbivorous diet, primarily composed of green parts of grasses, sedges, and herbs (Krapp 1978).;;Marmots were previously hunted for meat, fur, and fat (which was used for cosmetics and medicines). Hunting continues today, but is primarily a leisure activity (Preleuthner 1999). In Slovenia and Austria, hunting levels are sustainable, but in Austria at least populations living below the timberline are threatened by loss of open habitats through abandonment of high-altitude cattle grazing (Spitzenberger 2002, B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006). Hybridisation with introduced M. m. marmota is a potential future threat to remaining pure-bred populations of M. m. latirostris in the High Tatras.
M108;Marmota_bobak;"It inhabits a variety of steppe habitats, including lowland, mixed grass, arid, and wormwood (Artemisia) steppes. Forms colonies consisting of several families. Burrows are complex, and may be up to 4-5 m in depth. There are summer and winter burrows, both with pronounced mounds. Does not stock up for winter; instead hibernates for at least six months a year. Enters hibernation at different times in differents parts of the range, leaves hibernation in late March-April. Feeds on green parts, bulbs, flowers and shoots of grasses. Sensitive to moisture in food and in overly dry conditions enters estivation. Reproduces once a year with litter size of 4 to 7 young.";;Severe population and range reductions in the early to mid 20th century were caused by excessive hunting and habitat loss (cultivation of steppe grassland). Some illegal hunting continues.
M263;Spalax_leucodon;The mole rat inhabits steppe grassland, meadows and pastures, in areas with a deep layer of loose, freely-draining soil in which it digs its extensive burrows.  It has a slow reproductive rate, raising litters of only 2-4 young (Kryštufek 1999). Mole-rats of the genus Spalax can be distinguished from all other rodents by the lack of any external openings for the eyes, although small eyes are present under the skin (Nowak 1999).;It is absent from ploughed land and arable monocultures, although it may be found in agricultural lanscapes where there is a mixture of pastures, small crop-fields and orchards.;The mole-rat is threatened by habitat loss and land-use changes related to agricultural intensification and increased urbanisation and infrastructure development. It disappears when natural grasslands or pastures are ploughed up. When it was more common, it was an agricultural pest, and it is still persecuted as such in some areas (Kryštufek 1999).
M264;Spalax_microphthalmus;"Obligatory subterranean species. Inhabits steppes; prefers lowlands with black earth and. Inhabits crop fields, melon plantations, gardens, orchards and forest belts. Feeds on underground parts of dandelion, cow parsnip, chicory and tree seedlings (oak, mulberry, acacia). Makes hoards for winter, sometimes up to 10-14 kg. Breeds once a year, females give birth in March to 2-5 young. During dispersal juveniles emerge above ground and often fall prey to carnivorous mammals and birds. A significant pest in southern parts of the range."; avoids loamy and sandy soils;Ploughing of major habitats and use of toxic chemicals for pest control.
M262;Spalax_graecus;It inhabits steppe grassland, pastures, small cultivated fields and orchards, often preferring northern exposures (Kryštufek 1999, B. Kryštufek pers. comm. 2006). Individuals aggregate in winter but disperse in summer (Kryštufek 1999). The mole-rat is a fossorial species, digging extensive and elaborate tunnel systems with nesting chambers, storerooms and latrines (Nowak 1999). It feeds on bulbs, roots, tubers, and other underground parts of a range of plants (Nowak 1999). Mole-rats of the genus Spalax can be distinguished from all other rodents by the lack of any external openings for the eyes, although small eyes are present under the skin (Nowak 1999).;Very arid areas are avoided (Nowak 1999). ;Its congener Spalax leucodon is threatened by agricultural intensification, as it cannot survive in intensively-farmed arable land. Spalax graecus may be similarly vulnerable to intensive agriculture. Subsistence agriculture continues in Transylvania, and the mole rat population appears to be stable there (I. Coroiu pers. comm. 2006), at least for the time being. However, accession of Romania to the EU might be expected to result in agricultural intensification in the near future.
M261;Spalax_giganteus;Inhabits loamy and sandy semi-deserts in NE CIS-Caucasia. Prefers moderately moist areas with light soils in river valleys, lake basins and lowlands with luxuriant vegetation. Also occurs in semi-deserts with shrubs and reed, herb-grasses and herb-absinth steppes. Also found in anthropogenic landscapes such as orchards and fields, where it may be a pest. Obligatory subterranean, feeds on subterranean plant parts. Active throughout the year. Generally monogamous. Heat occurs in December-January, females give birth to 2-3 young.;;Habitat loss due to irrigation and subsequent soil salinization, overgrazing, and ploughing. Low reproductive potential is a further limiting factor.
M259;Spalax_arenarius;Stenotopic, inhbits light, moderately wet sandy soils with low subterranean waters.Preferres absinth-grass and absinth-spurge steppes with very sparse vegetation. Ecology is poorly studied. Solitary, individual range is more than 80 m2. Feeds on most plants that are abundant in its range (Eryngium campestre, Artemisia campestris, Tragopogon ucrainicum etc.). Reproduces once a year. Copulation occurs in March, birth in April-May. Lactation period is about a month.; Never occurs in moving sands, alkali soils and in dry feather-grass steppes. ;Habitat loss due to afforestation of the sands.
M265;Spalax_nehringi;;;
M267;Spalax_zemni;The major habitat of this species is virgin steppes. It also occurs in side roads, forest belts, and agricultural fields, and was recently found in former military firing ranges (I. Zagorodnyuk pers. comm. 2006). Does not avoid sandy soils. An obligate underground species. Its feeding habits are poorly studied, but according to data from southern and south-eastern part of the range it feeds on underground parts of lucerne, chicory, bindweed, mallows and tree seedlings (oak, mulberry, acacia etc.). There are no data on breeding or ecology.;;Habitat degradation and loss due to cultivation and development is a major threat.
